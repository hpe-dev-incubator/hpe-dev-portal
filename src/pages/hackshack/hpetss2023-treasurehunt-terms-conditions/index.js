            phone, or (ii) accessing the HPE Developer Community Hack Shack

            6. <strong>PRIZE:</strong> Interested parties who merely complete
            the Treasure Hunt form or submit an entry are not guaranteed a
            Prize. The total estimated retail value of each Prize is 30.00
            Euros. HPE will give away a total of three (3) Prizes, with a total
            estimated retail value of 90.00 Euros. At the end of the Program
            Period, three (3) potential winners will be selected from all
            eligible entries received during the Program Period. A panel of two
            (2) HPE judges will select the three (3) winners who they determine
            have submitted the best Treasure Hunt entries based on the following
            criteria: Completeness, accuracy of responses, and date/time of the
            submission. Odds of winning depend on the total number of eligible
            entries received during the Program Period. Should you be awarded a
            Prize, it shall be your responsibility to claim the Prize by
            visiting the HPE GreenLake booth on Thursday, May 25, 2023 between
            12:15 PM Central European Time and 12:45 PM Central European Time in
            the Event show floor. In order to win a Prize, participants must be
            present at the HPE GreenLake booth at the time the winners are
            announced. Failure to be present will result in forfeiture of the
            Prize, and an alternate winner may be selected from among the
            remaining eligible entries.

            Prizes, except in HPE’s sole discretion. The Prize may not be used
            for resale or distribution. Taxes and duties, if any, are winner’s
            responsibility. Each participant is limited to one (1) Prize only
            and any entries submitted after a participant has already received a
            Prize will not be an eligible entry. Any Prize details not specified
            herein will be determined by HPE in its sole discretion. HPE
            reserves the right to not fulfill your Prize in the event that the
            Prize is not certified in your country. Due to abuse, we cannot
            provide Prizes to individuals who submitted their entry with Yahoo,

            employees) or your company (for external participants). Please speak
            directly to your HPE representative if you have any questions.

            discretion. Without limiting the foregoing, HPE reserves the right,

            to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any person participating in or
            connected with the Program. Any attempt by you to obtain more than
            the stated number of entries by using multiple or different
            identities, or any other prohibited methods will void your entry and
            you shall be disqualified. Use of any automated system to
            participate is prohibited and will result in disqualification. HPE’s
            server shall be the official time stamp for the purposes of
            determining the validity of any participation in the Program (where
            applicable). HPE employees are expected to abide by the SBC and all
            other HPE policies. Failure to do so will negate an employee’s
            eligibility to participate in this Program and/or to redeem the
            Prize.
