It gives a clear idea of what information means by presenting it in the form of visuals like graphs, charts, maps, etc. This makes data more comprehensible for the human mind and as a result, makes it easier to identify patterns in large datasets.",

Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine. Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems. Similar to other common Container Engines (Docker, CRI-O, containerd), Podman relies on an OCI compliant Container Runtime (runc, crun, runv, etc) to interface with the operating system and create the running containers. This makes the running containers created by Podman nearly indistinguishable from those created by any other common container engine.",
