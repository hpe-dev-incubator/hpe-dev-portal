## The open-source advantage: Exploring machine learning through thought leadership
October 18, 2023

In our next Munch & Learn, Chase Christensen and Amber Graner from the HPE Ezmeral team get real about why machine learning is a big deal today. They break down what machine learning actually means and how thought leadership fits into this tech scene. They’ll explore all the perks of open-source machine learning and even name-drop some tools and libraries that are shaking things up in the field. Join us to hear them share some success stories showing how big thinkers can spark more use and development of these forward-thinking principles. To wrap things up, they’ll throw out a challenge to everyone listening, encouraging you to get involved and help shape the future of open-source machine learning!
