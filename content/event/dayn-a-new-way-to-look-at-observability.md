## DayN+ - A new way to look at observability

April 16, 2025

Traditional monitoring systems focus mainly on metrics, predefined thresholds, and manual log analysis to monitor system and application health. With the integration of cloud technologies, IT environments have become significantly more distributed and complex. This complexity reduces visibility into resources, forcing IT operations into an inefficient, reactive problem-solving mode. This situation has led to the emergence of observability.
Join this session to learn how an effective observability practice integrates people, processes, and tools to foster collaboration, break down silos, and enable proactive detection, diagnosis, and resolution of issues.
