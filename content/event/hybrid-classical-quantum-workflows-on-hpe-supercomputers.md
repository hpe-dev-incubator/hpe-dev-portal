## Hybrid Classical-Quantum Workflows on HPE Supercomputers

October 16, 2024

Quantum computing is an active area of research that has attracted attention from key players in academia and industry. While quantum devices are expected to perform well for certain problems involving a small amount of data but high complexity, classical supercomputers continue to better serve researchers in areas with data-intensive workloads relying on software tools and infrastructure developed over decades. In conjunction with several possibly tightly integrated Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, classical supercomputers would be valuable candidates for the execution of hybrid workflows while sustaining the classical portion of the computation and communication of potentially large data volumes. Join this talk to get an overview of the collaboration between Classiq and HPE on this topic.
