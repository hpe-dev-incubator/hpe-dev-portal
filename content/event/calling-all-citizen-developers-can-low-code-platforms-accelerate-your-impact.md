## Calling all citizen developers: Can low-code platforms accelerate your impact? 

November 16, 2022

Across industries, low-code citizen development platforms are unleashing creative talent to solve problems. In this session, HPE colleagues from the Office of the CTO, Education Services, and HR will provide an introduction into this powerful technology and how they have been able to build award-winning and enterprise-grade apps and automations—often with little-to-no budget. Even full-time developers can benefit from learning about low-code citizen development platforms to create “full stack” solutions outside of their areas of expertise.
