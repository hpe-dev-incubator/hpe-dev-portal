## Galadriel -  An alternative approach to SPIRE federation

February 22, 2023

SPIFFE and SPIRE contribute to strong identification and attestation of workloads in cloud native environments. A more scalable alternative to its current federation method, Galadriel, proposes to facilitate SPIRE federation of multiple trust domains via a central exchange hub. Join this Meetup to learn more about some of the limitations of the current federation method and how Galadriel’s architecture aims to address these, providing a simpler, more scalable solution.
