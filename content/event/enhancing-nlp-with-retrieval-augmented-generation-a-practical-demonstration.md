## Enhancing NLP with Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Practical Demonstration

September 18, 2024

In the evolving landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stands out as a powerful technique that enhances the NLP application by incorporating relevant external information. In this session, we will delve into the fundamentals and applications of RAG, providing a comprehensive overview of how it integrates retrieval mechanisms with generative capabilities to produce more accurate and contextually aware responses. We will then transition into a live demonstration showcasing the practical usage of RAG and the process of augmenting a generative model with external knowledge sources, showcasing how RAG improves the relevance and quality of generated outputs in real-time applications.
