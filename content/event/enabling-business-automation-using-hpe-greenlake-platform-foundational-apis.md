## Enabling business automation using HPE GreenLake platform foundational APIs

March 27, 2024

The HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, now offers application programming interfaces (APIs) for many common services, such as workspace management, identity and access management, device and subscription, locations, audit logs, and wellness. In this session, explore using the HPE GreenLake Developer Portal to access them and see how to invoke these APIs using an OpenAPI tool, such as Postman.
