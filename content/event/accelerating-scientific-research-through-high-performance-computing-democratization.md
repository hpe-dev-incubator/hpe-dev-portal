## Accelerating scientific research through high performance computing democratization

February 15, 2023

Large, complex computer simulations of the physical world are becoming more common-place thanks to the broader availability of high performance computing resources. Contemporaneously, the advent of open-source software, data science libraries, and machine-learning frameworks mean that some aspect of software engineering is now required of domain scientists. In this session, you’ll learn how these advances necessitate collaborations amongst software engineers, data scientists, and domain scientists and explore a specific use case delivering the first realistic global simulations of the world’s oceans.
