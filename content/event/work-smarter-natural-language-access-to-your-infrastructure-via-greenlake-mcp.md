## Work Smarter: Natural Language Access to your infrastructure via GreenLake MCP

 
Speakers: Vanderwilly Silva Roman Nersyan
Abstract:

Managing infrastructure often means navigating complex consoles, learning APIs, and manually generating reports. But what if there was an easier way?

GreenLake MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers enable AI assistants to securely access your infrastructure data, letting you ask questions in natural language. In this session, we'll explain what MCP is, show you how it works, and demonstrate practical examples: from handling device inventory to security audits.

No special technical expertise is needed in order to get valuable insights out of this session. If you've ever wished that working with infrastructure could be simpler, this session is for you.
