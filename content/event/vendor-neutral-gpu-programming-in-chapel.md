## Vendor-Neutral GPU Programming in Chapel

July 31, 2024

Writing programs on modern computers requires parallelism to achieve maximum performance. This is complicated by GPUs, which provide great parallel performance at the price of more complex programming. Chapel is an open-source parallel programming language that supports portable, performant software on CPUs and GPUs using a single unified set of language features. In this talk, we will showcase Chapel's vendor-neutral GPU support and share user experiences writing GPU-enabled programs in Chapel and show how you can write vendor-neutral GPU programs today. How you can get involved in our open-source work and our future plans will conclude this talk.
