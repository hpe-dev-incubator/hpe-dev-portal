## AI Inferencing at the Edge: Use Cases from Earth to Space

February 12, 2025

High-stake operating environments can add additional challenges when it comes to implementing AI technologies. Whether your use case is focused on speeding up time-to-target while maintaining data security or handling rugged and remote computing environments outside your data center, there are important considerations you need to take into account. Join us in our next session as we explore public sector and space-deployed AI-use cases, spanning the use of RAG for knowledge retrieval to the use of computer vision for image identification.
