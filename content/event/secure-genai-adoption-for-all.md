## Secure GenAI Adoption for all!

February 21, 2024

GenAI can bring great value to a business by providing a new interface that can be used to accelerate creativity, run knowledge-centric tasks, or simply provide more rapid access to information. However, rapid adoption of this technology has led to security snafu's, privacy issues and hallucinogenic data reaching the wrong people. In this session, we will look at how some of these risks have made it into the critical path for GenAI and how we might start to mitigate these issues through technology and processes. Finally, we will review "Project Ethan", which was highlighted on the mainstage at Discover Barcelona by HPE CTO, Fidelma Russo, to see how this project will bridge the gap from rapid innovation to secure business value. Join us for a lively presentation and discussion.
