## LL-Mesh – Democratizing Gen AI

December 18, 2024

LL-Mesh is a pioneering initiative by HPE aimed at democratizing Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI). It empowers users to create tools and web applications using Gen AI with Low or No Coding. This approach addresses the technical challenges by simplifying the integration process. Join this session to learn how LL-Mesh platform allows for the creation of a "Mesh" of the Gen AI tools, providing orchestration capabilities through an agentic Reasoning Engine based on Large Language Models (LLMs).
