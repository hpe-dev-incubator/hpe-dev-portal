## Implementing a complete Workshop-on-Demand infrastructure in less than an hour

December 17, 2025

Join our next meetup session to witness how quick and easy it can be to deploy a Workshop-on-Demand infrastructure so that you can deliver your own on-demand training sessions. Bruno Cornec (a former HPE Linux Distinguished Technologist) and Frederic Passeron from HPE Developer Community will demonstrate how you can achieve this goal.
