## The data services family of APIs for HPE GreenLake – Putting it all together

April 24, 2024

HPE recently announced a set of data services APIs for the HPE GreenLake platform for Backup and Recovery, Private Cloud Business Edition, Virtualization and common Data Services. In this session, a team of product managers and architects will present common API service interactions (e.g. hybrid services, data services, etc.) to accelerate your consumption of these APIs for use cases such as automation and monitoring. They’ll help you understand the benefits of these API modules, how to interact with them, and their relation to the Storage APIs published earlier.
