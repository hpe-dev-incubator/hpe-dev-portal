## No more blind spots: How eBPF transforms observability

March 26, 2025

In the world of modern cloud-native applications, traditional observability tools often fall short, leaving critical blind spots in performance monitoring, security, and troubleshooting. Enter eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter), a revolutionary technology that allows deep, low-overhead visibility into the Linux kernel without modifying application code or adding intrusive instrumentation. Join this session to explore how eBPF can transform observability by enabling real-time insights into system behavior, network traffic, and application performance.
