## Getting Started with Aruba Central automation

February 28, 2024

Learn how to configure, manage, and retrieve information using the various automation interfaces of Aruba Central in this session. Weâ€™ll explain how to access and utilize the REST APIs using the built-in user interface (UI) and Postman, how to manage the webhooks, and how to view the data from the streaming APIs.  These areas will be showcased in demos so that the audience can recreate the capabilities in their own environments.
