## Hybrid Cloud by Design : Optimizing Enterprise IT for Modern Workloads

September 17, 2024

Given the varying capacity, cost, performance, security, governance, and data locality requirements of enterprise workloads, hybrid cloud estates spanning on-premises private and off-premises public environments have become the default operating model for enterprise IT. The resulting increase in IT complexity often results in infrastructure silos instead of systems that deliver a unified cloud operating experience. Join Latha Vishnubhotla, Chief Platform Officer at HPE, and Melanie Posey, Research Director, 451 Research, for insights on how IT leaders formulate their hybrid cloud strategies to deal with this challenge.
