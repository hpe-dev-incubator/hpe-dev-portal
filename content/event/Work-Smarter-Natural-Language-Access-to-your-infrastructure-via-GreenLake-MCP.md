## Work Smarter: Natural Language Access to your infrastructure via GreenLake MCP

Jan 21, 2026

Managing infrastructure often means navigating complex consoles, learning APIs, and manually generating reports. But what if there was an easier way? GreenLake MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers enable AI assistants to securely access your infrastructure data, letting you ask questions in natural language. In this session, we'll explain what MCP is, show you how it works, and demonstrate practical examples: from handling device inventory to security audits.
Join this session to get valuable insights on MCP. If you've ever wished that working with infrastructure could be simpler, this session is for you.
