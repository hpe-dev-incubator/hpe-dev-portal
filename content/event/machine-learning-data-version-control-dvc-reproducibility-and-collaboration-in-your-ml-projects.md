## Machine Learning Data Version Control (DVC): Reproducibility and Collaboration in your ML Projects

September 28, 2022

In this session, we’ll do a demo where you’ll learn how to manage and make your machine learning projects reproducible with our open-source tool DVC and the DVC extension for VS Code IDE. We will see how to track datasets and models, run, compare, visualize, and track machine learning experiments right in VS Code. We'll then go over our GitOps-based model registry solution. Search, share, and manage all models with full context around model lineage, version, production status, data used to train model, and more.
