## How digital twins help companies reach their sustainability goals

June 12, 2024

As virtual replicas of physical systems, digital twins, help companies reach their sustainability goals by optimizing resource usage, reducing waste, and improving efficiency across the datacenter - from infrastructure to workloads. They enable predictive maintenance, energy conservation, and sustainable design, paving the way to optimize usage. In this session, weâ€™ll discuss about some of the on-going projects inside of HPE Labs and the Technology Incubations teams that investigate optimization and efficiency prediction for datacenters and associated workloads.
