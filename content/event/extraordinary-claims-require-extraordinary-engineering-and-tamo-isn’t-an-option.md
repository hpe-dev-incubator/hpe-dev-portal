## Extraordinary claims require extraordinary engineering (and TAMO isn’t an option)

March 15, 2023

So many challenges we face as a species demand an unprecedented ability to simulate and engineer at the scale where quantum mechanics dominate. In this session, Kirk Bresniker of Hewlett Packard Labs will give us his perspective on moving from quantum computing research to productization. His thoughts on approaching quantum computing development as a global community from the application down to the Qubits, as opposed to the other direction, offer insights on how to further its advancement.
