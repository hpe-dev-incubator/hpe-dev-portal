## The Transformative Impact of Generative AI on Telco Products

April 17, 2024

This session will showcase a PoC for an innovative application that demonstrates a bot capable of retrieving information and executing commands on Athonet 5G Networks. Utilizing an LLM as a core Reasoning Engine, our PoC highlights the integration of advanced AI capabilities without compromising human or customer data security. We’ll demonstrate how to maximize the benefits of our products based on Generative AI by establishing automatic data feedback loops. Thanks to AI, these loops will enhance our product with the ability to self-improve through the analysis of customer interactions, thereby boosting personalization and operational efficiency.
