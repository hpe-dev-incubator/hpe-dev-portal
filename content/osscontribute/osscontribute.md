description: Are you a fan of HPE Developer? Become an HPE Developer Evangelist
  and help us spread the word on how developers, data scientists, and IT
  technologists can write applications and develop integrations for Hewlett
  Packard Enterprise enabled environments. As an HPE Developer Evangelist,
  you’ll be the primary HPE Developer contact for your region/country for
  colleagues, HPE partners and customers. You’ll forward communications to them,
  alerting them of upcoming meetups, Munch & Learn sessions and promoting the
  newest Workshops-on-Demand.

In the world of open source, you need to be fluent with [Git](https://git-scm.com/). If you are not yet, we recommend you read the following 3-part blog series:

* [Getting started with Git](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-1-getting-started-with-git/)
* [Sharing with the community](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-2-sharing-with-the-commun/)
* [Contributing back](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-3-contributing-back-to-th/)

We also offer a Workshop-on-Demand that you can take to get hands-on experience with Git. Feel free to register by clicking below:

* [Getting started with Git](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-1-getting-started-with-git/)

When you get started with open source, it means that you will either contribute to an existing project or create your own project. We estimate that there are 200 millions packages on GitHub today, so finding the right place to engage is not that easy. If you are looking for a good project to contribute to, we suggest the following list (in alphabetical order):

If you want to create your own project, feel free to do so and create a public repo for it. For HPE employees, be aware that there is an open source review process you need to follow before releasing any code to open source. Make sure you check this [HPE-only website](https://opensource.corp.hpecorp.net/osrp_process_upstream.html).

HPE has a number of contributors/maintainers that we have highlighted in a series of blog posts. Read about their respective journeys and join them in our Hall of Fame:

* [Souptick Joarder](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/becoming-a-linux-kernel-contributor-following-the-journey-of-souptick-joarder/) (Linux kernel)

One last piece of advice. When joining an existing open source project in order to contribute, you will have to make yourself known to other contributors and maintainers. This might take time. Be patient. Start small, by documenting issues in the code or in the documentation and propose a solution. You can also review and comment on proposed changes. In most cases, there will be a Slack or a glitter forum dedicated to the project. Don’t hesitate to join and start discussion there. Once your name becomes associated with good feedback and proposals, it will be a lot easier for you to contribute code and get it approved and merged. 

And that’s when it gets really exciting! Enjoy the journey!
