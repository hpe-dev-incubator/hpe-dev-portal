In open source land, you need to be fluent with Git. If it’s not the case yet, we recommend the following 3 part blogs:

* [Getting started with git](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-1-getting-started-with-git/)
* [Sharing with the community](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-2-sharing-with-the-commun/)
* [Contributing back](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-3-contributing-back-to-th/)

We also have a Workshop-on-Demand which you can use to get hands-on experience with git. Feel free to use:
