description: "Managing infrastructure often means navigating 
complex consoles,learning APIs, and manually generating reports.
But what if there was an easier way?
GreenLake MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers enable 
AI assistants to securely access your infrastructure data,
letting you ask questions in natural language. In this session, 
we'll explain what MCP is, show you how it works, 
and demonstrate practical examples: from handling 
device inventory to security audits.
No special technical expertise is needed in order 
to get valuable insights out of this session. 
If you've ever wished that working with infrastructure
could be simpler, this session is for you."
