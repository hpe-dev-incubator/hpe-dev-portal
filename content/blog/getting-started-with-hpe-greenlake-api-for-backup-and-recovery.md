## W﻿hat's new?

Recently, a new set of REST APIs for HPE GreenLake for Backup and Recovery Service was introduced in the HPE GreenLake Developer [website](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/backup-recovery/public/). This is the third blog post from the series of blog postings ([Data-Services](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/getting-started-with-hpe-greenlake-api-for-data-services), [Virtualization](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/getting-started-with-hpe-greenlake-api-for-virtualization), [Backup and Recovery](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/getting-started-with-hpe-greenlake-api-for-backup-and-recovery)) that introduce some useful tips and best practices about using this new set of APIs given a specific use case. 

This set of APIs provides the capability for manipulating resources made available by HPE GreenLake for Backup and Recovery services. Consequently, any customer can use these APIs to protect their data in a hybrid cloud in the same manner as using the user interface for HPE GreenLake for Backup and Recovery in the HPE GreenLake console.  This set of APIs provides user capabilities to perform any of Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations against HPE GreenLake Backup and Recovery resources such as: *data-orchestrator, protection store gateway, StoreOnce, protection-stores, protection-policies, snapshots, backups, on-premises assets (VM, DataStore, MSSQL, Storage Volumes).* 

There will be more resources added into this set of APIs in the future releases that will cover *cloud service providers, and cloud assets*. For more information on how to use this HPE GreenLake for Backup and Recovery service, please visit the [website ](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/hpe-greenlake-backup-recovery.html)and the getting started [guide](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docLocale=en_US&docId=sd00003454en_us). 

The specification of this API is publicized as an OpenAPI specification in JSON format, and the specification is available for download from this [section](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/backup-recovery/public/guide/) of the documentation (shown below). The specification follows the OpenAPI Standard v3.1, and it contains all required information so that this JSON file can be consumed by any OpenAPI tools to provide client library, server mock, or documentation as described in this [OpenAPI ](https://tools.openapis.org/)Initiative.

> **NOTE:** 
> There are two different sets of OpenAPI specs that are downloadable from the documentation page of the Backup and Recovery in the March 2024 release. The two sets represent the two versions of Backup and Recovery APIs that were made available for separate resources, namely **hypervisor-managers** and **the rest of other resources** as shown in this picture below. To get into the page for downloading each of the OpenAPI specification file, scroll through the left windows and select the appropriate API version page.

![GLBR API documentation website](/img/backup-and-recovery-api-front-download-page.jpg "Front page for Backup & Recovery front page")

The Backup and Recovery API specification files contain information that describes the set of REST APIs for HPE GreenLake for Backup and Recovery, such as the endpoints, authentication, syntax of parameters, expected response, and many other objects.

![GLBR openapi spec](/img/backup-and-recovery-json-information.png "JSON open API spec example")

*The above figure shows the example of the downloaded backup-and-recovery v1beta1.json file from the Backup and Recovery API documentation [guide](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/backup-recovery/public/guide/).*

## API versioning

This set of APIs is released with two different specifications which are identified as revision V1 Alpha 1 and V1 Beta 1 at the time of i﻿ts release i﻿n March 2024. The short-term plan is to publish version 1 of the HPE GreenLake APIs for Backup and Recovery Service to replace the V1 Alpha 1 and V1 Beta 1 versions. Once the API is at version 1, the intent is to keep changes to the minimum required and publicly announce changes as they are made. As each individual API is updated, there will also be more capabilities added to any of the resources identified under this set of APIs.  For information regarding updates and deprecation, please refer the HPE GreenLake Developer Portal Versioning [guide](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/guides/public/standards/versioning_basics/). You can expect that the API categorized as V1 Alpha 1 will be updated within a short time; hence, I recommend you monitor for any announcement of the next revision of APIs for Backup and Recovery in this documentation [guide](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/backup-recovery/public/guide/).

> **NOTE:** 
> At the time of its release in March 2024, all of resources for HPE GreenLake API for Backup and Recovery are limited to data protection of on-premises assets. The manipulation of the cloud assets will be made available in the next release.

## W﻿hat are Backup and Recovery API resources?

There are a lot of resources that are part of this set o﻿f APIs . Therefore, I like to break them down into two parts so that I can present the familiar view of the components that correspond to the resources. 

The below diagram displays components in the first part of the HPE GreenLake API for Backup and Recovery. These components consist of resources considered to be part of the infrastructure for HPE GreenLake for Backup and Recovery on-premises and in the cloud. These components must be deployed prior to operation of the HPE GreenLake for Backup and Recovery. The on-premises components consist of  Data Orchestrator VM, Protection Store Gateway VM or HPE StoreOnce (purpose-built backup appliance). Additionally, the cloud components consist of the data services instance deployed at HPE GreenLake workspace and the cloud protection store to contain the cloud recovery points (backups). The information on how to get started with HPE GreenLake for Backup and Recovery is available in the support [website](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=sd00003102en_us&page=bar_overview_dscc.html).

![GLBR architecture 1](/img/glbr-architecture-overview-1.png)

*The above figure shows the resources that are part of the infrastructure u﻿sed to accommodate the data protection for HPE GreenLake for Backup and Recovery.*

The second part of the HPE GreenLake API for Backup and Recovery resources is the resources from which HPE GreenLake for Backup and Recovery provides protection from data loss. In below diagram, you will see those assets which contains the components that need to be protected and the components which the assets are allocated at. Those components, such as virtual machine, datastore, or SQL database application, storage volumes, or physical hosts, are the assets that need to be protected. Nevertheless, other assets in this category include the components for the hypervisor, compute servers, storage array, networking, and the VMware vCenter that manage the hypervisor components. This HPE GreenLake API must maintain the inventory of all the on-premises assets that are protected by querying the VMware vCenter.

![GLBR architecture 2](/img/glbr-architecture-overview-2.png)

*The above figure displays resources that are parts of the hypervisor and on-premises components that can be protected.*

> **NOTE:**
> In the current HPE GreenLake Developer website, there is a single resource categorized as V1 Alpha 1 that will be used to register, unregister, and update the hypervisor-manager to an instance of HPE GreenLake Backup and Recovery. The current supported on-premises hypervisor-manager is VMware vCenter version 7.0 or later. The HPE GreenLake API to discover t﻿he already onboarded hypervisor-manager is available from the virtualization API [set](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/virtualization/public/openapi/virtualization-public-v1beta1/tag/hypervisor-managers/). 

### What about the components in HPE GreenLake Backup and Recovery that are not mentioned above?

There are other resources that exist in the HPE GreenLake for Backup and Recovery that are not mentioned above; however, they are available in the user-interface for HPE GreenLake for Backup and Recovery. A couple of those resources are protection policy and protection group. The protection group is used to consolidate a multiple number of assets with a particular protection policy. On the other hand, the protection-policy is a resource to consolidate the schedule of protection-jobs and the flow of the recovery points at different tiers of protection-store. Together, both protection policy and protection group deliver the management of the Recovery Point Objective for data protection using HPE GreenLake for Backup and Recovery.

![Protection policy for vmware schedule](/img/protection-policy-ui-for-vmware-scheduling.png)

*The above figure displays resources for schedule and the flow of the recovery-points part of the protection policy.*

Additionally, there is also a resource known as protection job that is obscurely shown in the user-interface; however, it is required to perform the operation of data protection. You will need to manipulate protection jobs to create a protection or to recover an existing recovery point. Additionally, the protection-job is the resource that can be manipulated to suspend or to resume a protection schedule.

![Protection jobs for scheduling and protection tiers](/img/protection-jobs-ui.png)

*T﻿he above figure displays the representation of protection jobs for the protected assets. The protection jobs are available after a protection policy applied to an asset or a protection groups for multiple assets.* 

Beyond protection-jobs, there are recovery points (also known as copies). These are resources that are used to represent that recovery points inside the protection store, and they are used to perform the recovery of assets. 

> **Note** that even though there are three different categories of recovery-points that are available in the protection policy, there are only two different resources. 

The first resource is called snapshots to represent copies that exist inside the storage array. The second resource is called backups to represent copies that exist inside the on-premises protection store such as Protection Store Gateway, and copies that exist inside the cloud protection store. 

The cloud protection store is a repository that sits in the cloud public providers that are managed by HPE, and these can exist either in AWS or Microsoft Azure. All of these recovery points exist in relation to the assets, where the recovery can be initiated using the HPE GreenLake API. 

![Protection copies for hierarchy](/img/protection-copies.png)

## Using the Backup and Recovery APIs

This set of Backup and Recovery APIs use the same authorization and permission as the rest of the family of HPE GreenLake API for data services. To ensure that all programmatic interaction with the HPE GreenLake platform services and resources is secure and authenticated, these APIs require an access token. The token is generated using the client ID and client Secret you acquired during the creation of the client API credentials. 

Documentation concerning getting started with the HPE GreenLake API is provided on the HPE Developer Community [website](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/oauth2-for-hpe-greenlake-data-services-cloud-console/) and on the HPE GreenLake Developer portal [website](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/). There is also blog [post](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/learn-what-you-can-do-with-hpe-data-services-cloud-console-api-in-just-3-minutes/) that describes how to use publicly available tool to manipulate this API without a programming language, such as Postman. An additional blog post that describes using Postman for this API is also available in this [link](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/oauth2-for-hpe-greenlake-data-services-cloud-console/). 

Lastly, anyone can follow the examples provided by each API reference in the documentation page, such as the `GET /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-jobs`, which is shown i﻿n the figure b﻿elow. The documentation provides detail on the API syntax for a particular method, arguments used for the API, expected successful and failed responses, and several examples of creating the automation script using cURL, JavaScript, Python, and Go. The documentation page also provides the ability to execute the API directly on the documentation page as explained in the previous blog [post](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/getting-started-with-hpe-greenlake-api-for-data-services/) (Getting started with HP GreenLake Data Services API).

![HPE GLBR API documentation ](/img/reference-document-for-hpe-glbr.png)

*The above figure shows the three-panel of the interactive API reference documentation for one of HPE GreenLake APIs for Backup and Recovery.*

## Some tips and examples

The interactive API reference documentation guide provides information about the parameters and request payload (body) key-pair values required for every available HPE GreenLake API for Backup and Recovery. Additionally, I am presenting some use cases with detailed information on providing the correct parameters or building the correct request payload (body) key-pairs JSON structure required to achieve the use case.

> **NOTE:** 
> The below examples assume that HPE GreenLake Backup and Recovery had been deployed, it was connected to an HPE array onboarded to HPE GreenLake, a VMware vCenter had been discovered, and some virtual machines had been deployed and discovered by HPE GreenLake Backup and Recovery. For more information on getting started with HPE GreenLake Backup and Recovery, please visit t﻿he Getting Started guide on HPE support [website](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docLocale=en_US&docId=sd00003454en_us&page=GUID-F25ABD00-C36B-42D8-A443-82584EE8E35A.html).

## Creating a cloud protection store

A protection store is the critical resource that is required to store the recovery points on-premises and in the cloud. The cloud protection stores are created on top of either the Protection Store Gateway or HPE StoreOnce, because either one is required for connections to cloud protection-stores. To perform this use case in the below example, we will need to discover the StoreOnce and the storage location of the cloud protection store.

> **NOTE:** 
> You will see in this blog post that I used a combination of b﻿oth HPE GreenLake APIs from [data services](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/data-services/public/guide/) and [virtualization](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/virtualization/public/) to accomplish the below examples.

The example below displays the creation of the cloud protection store in the HPE GreenLake protection store at Microsoft Azure cloud storage.

![UI to create a cloud protection s﻿ite o﻿n Microsoft Azurea﻿t the eastus2 storage location](/img/ui-to-create-cloud-protection.png)

*T﻿he figure above shows the user interface used to create a cloud store protection at Microsoft Azure in eastus2 storage location using the user interface.* 

H﻿ere is the list of the steps required to perform this use case using HPE GreenLake API:

1. I used the [API](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/backup-recovery/public/openapi/backup-recovery-public-v1beta1/operation/StoreOncesList/) to discover the StoreOnce instance that can connect to the cloud protection store and copi﻿ed the id which will be used as the value for storageSystemId as shown in below JSON request body. The API used for this is: `GET /backup-recovery/v1beta1/storonces?limit=20&offset=0`.

![Discover deployed StoreOnce to create cloud protection store](/img/api-discover-storeonce.png)

2. Next, I discovered the cloud storage at the correct location from the list of the available storage location and copy the `storageLocationId` as shown in below JSON response body. The discovery was done by using t﻿he HPE GreenLake [API](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/data-services/public/openapi/data-services-public-v1beta1/operation/ListLocations/) f﻿or D﻿ata Services API set. Note from the below figure that I used filter `“backup-and-recovery”` in capabilities to capture selected storage locations with the correct capability. The below figure shows information about the location (region) where the data will be stored; conversely, it’s located at `“Richmond”`, cloud service provide was `“AZURE”`, and cloud services provider identification is `“eastus2”`. I﻿ the c﻿opied value `"azure:eastus2"` from the key `id` of this API's response body as the `storageLocationID` value. The API used for this: `GET /data-services/v1beta1/storage-locations?filter=”backup-and-recovery” in capabilities`.

![API to figure out the Azure storage location](/img/figure-out-storage-location.png)

3. Moving forward, I composed the cloud protection store at the storage location using values from the previous both API responses. For this API execution, I created a request JSON body structure for `POST /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-stores` that contains some of the key-pair values from the previous API response. The below figure shows that the creation of protection stores using the JSON body structure to compose the cloud protection store that was connected to the HPE StoreOnce. 

> The below REST API will be executed asynchronously, and I recognized from the Response status that this API was properly executed as shown by the `Status 0x202 Accepted`. From the Header's location field part of the response body, I copied the task Id and stored that id into variable `{{TaskId}}` so that I could track the completion of this REST API.

![API composing the protection store](/img/api-compose-protection-store.png)

> **Note:** T﻿he figure below shows all the fields about [this](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/backup-recovery/public/openapi/backup-recovery-public-v1beta1/operation/ProtectionStoreCreate/) JSON body structures provided on the interactive documentation of `POST /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-stores` under Payload tab.

![API Request body JSON to compose protection Store](/img/api-to-create-protection-stores-request-json-body.png)

4. After roughly five minutes, the cloud protection store was completely created based on response of the following `GET /data-services/async-operations/{Id}` [API](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/data-services/public/openapi/data-services-public-v1beta1/operation/GetAsyncOperation/) where `{{TaskId}}` came from previously executed API response.

> ***Note:*** I used a set of selection parameters in the figure below to provide a summary of this task information:
>
> ```shellsession
> GET /data-services/v1beta1/async-operations/{{taskId}}/select=associatedResources,createdAt,displayName,customerId,logMessages,progressPercent,state
> ```
>
> I copied the task’s Id from the response header’s location value of the prior API execution into a Postman’s variable called `{{taskId}}`, and incorporated t﻿he variable to the `async-operations` API execution as shown below.

![Task completion on POST protection-stores](/img/api-async-on-post-protection-stores.png)

5. For reference, I went into the Protection Stores menu as shown in the figure below to show the available HPE GreenLake Backup and Recovery p﻿rotection-stores, and confirmed that the desired protection store was available.

![Validating cloud protection store has been created](/img/ui-validated-cloud-protection-store-completed.png)

## Creating a Protection-Policy

A common use-case that every user of HPE GreenLake Backup and Recovery will deploy is the creation of a protection-policy. This resource is important because it sets up the schedule for creation of recovery point. Additionally, it sets up the flow of a recovery point from a primary storage to a storage snapshot, to on-premises protection-store and eventually to the cloud protection-store. 

A protection policy contains several JSON objects that are displayed in the figure b﻿elow.

1. A schedule that contains the frequency for creation of the copy and time to retain the copies.
2. Protection store where the copies are stored: snapshot (in the primary array), on-premises store, and cloud store.
3. Length of time when the copy is being locked to satisfy immutability.
4. The pre-script information that contains the link to the scripts to be executed prior to the creation of the copy.
5. The post-script information that contains the link to the scripts to be executed after the creation of the copy.

![API request body JSON for protection policy creation](/img/api-body-json-request-for-protection-policies.png)

﻿*The above figure shows the guide to create a protection-policy request body JSON structure.*

To simplify this example, I created a three-tier protection-policy for VMware as depicted by this snippet from the protection policy’s menu.

![3 Tiers protection policy ](/img/backup-protection-policy-with-3-tiers.png)

T﻿his is the list of the steps u﻿sed to create this protection policy:

1. From the figure below, inside the protection store gateways menu, I discovered the serial number of the protection-store gateway and used it as the filtering parameter to obtain the protection store gateway instance.  

![PSG UI to obtain the serial no](/img/psg-ui-to-show-the-serial-no.png)

2. Afterward, I used `GET /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-store-gateways` [API](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/backup-recovery/public/openapi/backup-recovery-public-v1beta1/operation/ProtectionStoreGatewaysList) and the `filter=serialNumber eq <StoreOnce SerialNo>` to figure out the `"<protection-store-gateway-id>"` that was associated with the protection-stores that would be incorporated into the protection-policy.

![API show registered PSG](/img/api-display-registered-psg.png)

3. From the figure below, I used `GET /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-stores` [API](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/backup-recovery/public/openapi/backup-recovery-public-v1beta1/operation/ProtectionStoreList/) to obtain the protection-store ids for both the on-premises protection store and the cloud protection store. To display protection-stores related to the protection store gateway, I used the parameter filter to display the exact the protection-store associated with protection storage gateway of `“<onprem-protection-store-id>”`. The filter parameter that I used are `protectionStoreType eq 'ON_PREMISES'` and `storageSystemInfo/id eq 'protection-store-gateway-id'`. Additionally, I used the following `select` parameter `name,displayName,id,status,state,protectionStoreType` to provide a shorter response that simplify the discovery of the protection-store on-premises. The API used for this: 

   ```shellsession
   GET /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-stores?select=name,displayName,id,status,state,protectionStoreType&filter=protectionStoreType eq ‘ON_PREMISES’ and storageSystemInfo/id eq “\<protection-store-gateway-id\>”
   ```

![API to obtain the onpremises protection store id](/img/api-to-get-onpremises-protection-store-id.png)

4. I repeated the same execution of the `GET /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-stores` to obtain the `"<cloud-protection-store-id>"`. To accomplish that, I used the following `filter: protectionStoreType eq 'CLOUD' and storageSystemInfo/id eq “<protection-store-gateway-id>”`.  Additionally, I also used the  parameter `select: name,displayName,id,status,state,protectionStoreType` to provide a shorter response for simpler discovery of the protection-store-id in the cloud. The API used for this: 

   ```shellsession
   GET /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-stores?select=name,displayName,id,status,state,protectionStoreType&filter=protectionStoreType eq ‘CLOUD’ and storageSystemInfo/id eq “<protection-store-gateway-id>”
   ```

![API to obtain cloud protection store id](/img/api-discover-cloud-protection-store-id.png)

5. For the next step, I created a request body JSON structure that represents the protection policy schedule and each of the protection stores. Inside this JSON structures for request body, I defined the three objects that represent the `SNAPSHOT, BACKUP (on-premises), CLOUD_BACKUP`. Note that this structure can be expanded or contracted depending on the required backup strategy. The SNAPSHOT object did not require `"<protection-store-Id>"` as that recovery points will exist inside the primary storage array. This request JSON body structure was required to create the protection policy using HPE GreenLake [API](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/backup-recovery/public/openapi/backup-recovery-public-v1beta1/operation/DataManagementTemplateCreate/) `POST /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-policies`.

> **Note:** I didn’t include objects for immutability, prescript, and postscript into the JSON structure. If it’s not intended, you don’t need to include unused key-pair values into the JSON structure. Additionally, the SNAPSHOT object does no require a `protectionStoreId`.

```

> *The above figure shows JSON structure for request body of `POST /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-policies` for the creation of protection-policy as shown by the example in this section.*

6. Finally, I created the protection policies using the HPE GreenLake API for Backup and Recovery `POST /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-policies`, and I used the above JSON structure in the request body. This is a special POST API execution where the response is returned immediately. The response of this API contained the body of JSON structure that will be useful to identify the protection-jobs such as the `“<protection-policies-id>”`.

![API to create protection policy](/img/api-to-create-protection-policy.png)

7. The below figure shows the complete response JSON body from the above API that shows the construction of the protection policy with different protection tiers and the schedules associated with the protection tier. The important values were the ids for different protection tiers that will be used for the next example.

   ```yaml
   ID: “<protection-policies-id>"
   SNAPSHOT: “<snapshot-protection-id>”
   ON-PREMISES: “<onprem-protection-id>”
   CLOUD: “<cloud-protection-id>”
   ```

## Applying protection policy to a Virtual Machine

Next in the list of use cases for this blog post, I followed the progression for the Day One activities. The next one is to protect a virtual machine t﻿hat is applying this protection policy to a virtual machine. 

T﻿hese are th﻿e steps required to apply the protection policy against a virtual machine:

1. I obtained the values from `virtual machine id, name, and type` keys t﻿hat were going to be used as the key-pair values required for the key `assetInfo` as shown in below figures. To obtain those, I used one of the HPE GreenLake [API](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/virtualization/public/openapi/virtualization-public-v1beta1/operation/VirtualMachinesList/) from Virtualization API set to discover the detail information of a virtual machine `“0-Linux-Demo-VM02”`. The API used for this: 

   ```shellsession
   GET /virtualization/v1beta1/virtual-machines?sort=name desc& select=appType,id,name,type,guestInfo,protectionJobInfo& filter=name eq '0-Linux-Demo-VM02'
   ```

![API to find virtual-machines and it's properties](/img/api-find-virtual-machines.png)

2. I created a JSON structure of a request body for applying the protection policy against a virtual machine without a protection group to make a simple example for this blog post. **Note** that this JSON body structure created the association of the asset, which is a virtual machine, against the protection policy. The two other parameters entered here were the consistency `(CRASH vs APPLICATION)` and technology for protection `(VMWARE_CBT vs VOLUME)`. The three values obtained from previous response of the previous API `POST /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-policies` associated with SNAPSHOT, BACKUP and CLOUD would be used as part of this request body. Each of t﻿hese protections will be identified with schedule id marked 1,2 and 3 as shown below. There are other options available as part of this JSON structure of this request body, and they are documented in the Payload tab of this interactive guide for this [API](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/backup-recovery/public/openapi/backup-recovery-public-v1beta1/operation/DataManagementJobCreate/).

3. In the figure below, I used HPE GreenLake [API](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/backup-recovery/public/openapi/backup-recovery-public-v1beta1/operation/DataManagementJobCreate/) for Backup and Recovery `POST /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-jobs` with the body JSON structure from the above so that I could associate the protection policy against a virtual machine. This POST API execution completed asynchronously and returned Status `0x202` with a response. The response header contained the `{{taskId}}` that I can use to ensure that this API completed properly.

![API to apply protection policy against the VM](/img/api-applying-the-protection-jobs-against-a-vm.png)

4. The API execution was executed successfully. I validated this completion using the task id that I obtained from the response headers as shown above. The API used for this: `GET /data-services/v1beta1/async-operations/{{taskId}}`

> **Note**: The execution of this API will trigger a protection execution right after the execution of this API completed.

![Task list to display completion of the application of protection policy against a VM producing protection jobs](/img/api-task-list-for-protection-policy-application.png)

## Triggering a protection

Once the protection policy named "VMware create three tiers" was bound to the virtual machine as shown above, I then issued a trigger to create cloud protection against the virtual machine `“0-Linux-Demo-VM02”` to create one-off cloud-protection.

The steps required to trigger the protection are listed below:

1. I figured out the `protection-job-id` that is associated with `“0-Linux-Demo-VM02”`. and the  cloud backup `schedule Id` of the virtual machine. To achieve that, I used the HPE GreenLake [API](`https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/backup-recovery/public/openapi/backup-recovery-public-v1beta1/operation/DataManagementJobsList`) for Backup and Recovery `GET /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-jobs` and `filter assetInfo/id eq "{VM-id}”` as shown below. Note that the variable `{vmId}` contained the value of the virtual machine id as discovered in previous e﻿xample, namely `"<virtual-machine-id>"`. The response body’s JSON structure contained the id of the protection job associated with `“0-Linux-Demo-VM02”`. From the same response body, I recognized that cloud protection is the `scheduleId no 3`. The API used for this:

   ```shellsession
   GET /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-jobs?filter=assetInfo/id eq {{vmId}}&select=assetInfo,id,operational,protections
   ```

![API to figure out protection-jobs](/img/api-to-figure-out-protection-jobs.png)

2. This use case is equivalent to run now button at the schedule of the `“0-Linux-Demo-V02”` on the selected cloud protection as shown in below figure. After clicking `“Run Now”` button, a cloud protection will commence against the virtual machine, a recovery point is going to be created at the cloud protection store. In next step, I will invoke `"Run Now"` on the `HPE Cloud Protection Store` using HPE GreenLake API for Backup and Recovery.

![UI for run now protection jobs](/img/gui-run-now-cloud-protection.png)

3. The HPE GreenLake API u﻿sed to accomplish the use case s﻿hown above was `POST /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-jobs/:id/run`, and the documentation of this [API](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/backup-recovery/public/openapi/backup-recovery-public-v1beta1/operation/DataManagementJobRun) also lists the required JSON structure for the request body. I created a JSON request body structure for this example as follows:

   ```jsonc
   {
      "﻿fullBackup": false,
      "﻿ScheduleIds": [3]
   }
   ```

> **Note:** There i﻿s a key called `“fullBackup”` inside the JSON request body to enable the creation of full protection where a backup will be created independently from the existing copies in the protection store. I also entered number 3 into `ScheduleIds` JSON array, to represent the cloud backup schedule. The below figure shows an example of the execution of `"run now"` without full backup protection of the third schedule, which is cloud protection of this virtual machine. The value `<protection-jobs-id>` will be entered from the parameter of this API in this manner: `POST /backup-recovery/v1beta1/protection-jobs/"<protection-jobs-id>"/run`.

![API to execute a protection run](/img/api-to-execute-a-protection.png)

4. The result from the API execution above can be validated from the API `/data-services/v1beta1/async-operations/:id` using the task id obtained from the above response header. The API used for this: `G﻿ET /data-services/v1beta1/async-operations/{{taskId}}`.

![API async-operations of execution of protection-jobs](/img/api-task-list-after-a-run-execution.png)

The activities above were validated from the HPE GreenLake Backup and Recovery list of the recovery points as shown in the figure below.

![GUI display the completed cloud protection run](/img/gui-cloud-run-now-completed-succesfully.png)

## Wow.. those were so cool! Can I recover a new virtual machine from that recovery point that I just created?

Each of the recovery points, regardless of the location of store (array snapshot, On-Premises Protection-Store, or HPE Cloud Protection-Store), can be recovered using the HPE GreenLake APIs for Backup and Recovery. 

1. To restore the backup from a virtual machine, this API requires a request body of JSON structure as documented in the HPE GreenLake developer website. In this blog post, I planned a demo of the steps to recover the virtual machine from a copy that had existed in the HPE Cloud Protection Store into the VMware cluster where the Protection Storage Gateway is hosted (recover as a new virtual machine). Copy the `{{vmId}}` from the response JSON body to be used on subsequent API execution. The API used for this:

   ```shellsession
   GET /virtualization/v1beta1/virtual-machines?sort=name desc&filter=name eq’0-Linux-Demo-VM02’&select=appType,id,name,type,guestinfo,protectionJobInfo
   ```

![API to discover backup for recovery of VM](/img/api-to-discover-vm-for-recovery.png)

2. Let's obtain the Cloud Recovery Point id for the cloud protection recovery from the virtual machine id from the step #1 using the HPE GreenLake [API](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/backup-recovery/public/openapi/backup-recovery-public-v1beta1/operation/VirtualMachineBackupList/) `GET /backup-recovery/v1beta1/virtual-machines/:id/backups` given the virtual machine id `{{vmId}}`. Copy the `{{backupId}}` from the response body from the below figure so that it can be used in the subsequent API execution. The API used for this: 

   ```shellsession
   GET /backup-recovery/v1beta1/virtual-machines/{{vmId}}/backups?select=name,description,backupType,id
   ```

![API to obtain the backup Id of a cloud recovery point](/img/api-to-obtain-backup-id-for-recovery.png)

3. Let's obtain the `datastore id` and the `cluster id` from the existing VMFS datastore that can accommodate the datastore type that this VM can be restored. In this hypervisor, I am using the datastore with the name `“0-BRS-VMFS-Test3”` and enter that as part of the filter into HPE GreenLake [API](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/virtualization/public/openapi/virtualization-public-v1beta1/operation/DatastoresList) `GET /virtualization/v1beta1/datastores`. The API used for this: 

   ```shellsession
   GET /virtualization/v1beta1/datastores?filter=displayName eq '0-BRS-VMFS-Test3'&select=clusterInfo,datastoreType,name,id
   ```

![API to obtain the cluster and datastore Ids](/img/api-obtain-cluster-and-datastore.png)

4. To obtain the hypervisor Network Id that is required to recover the recovery point into a new virtual machine, I had to discover the hypervisor id. The [API](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/virtualization/public/openapi/virtualization-public-v1beta1/operation/HypervisorManagerList/) used for this:

   ```shellsession
   GET /virtualization/v1beta1/hypervisor-manager?select=name,id,state,status,dataOrchestratorInfo,services,hypervisorManagerType,releaseVersion&filter=state eq "OK" and status eq "OK" and name eq "vCenter Name"
   ```

![API to get hypervisorId](/img/api-obtain-hypervisor-id.png)

5. To set the virtual machine network to the correct network port group, I'll need to look into into the existing virtual machine `"0-Linux-Demo-V02"`, and discovered the network port group `“Mgmt-DPortGroup”`. From the list of the network port group, I selected the associated n﻿etwork port group of the virtual machine by filtering the name of the port group. Afterward, we copied the `"<hypervisor-network-id>"` from the response body of this [API](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/virtualization/public/openapi/virtualization-public-v1beta1/operation/HypervisorNetwork/) to be used for subsequent execution. The API used for this:

   ```shellsession
   GET /virtualization/v1beta1/hypervisor-managers/{{hyperVisorId}}/networks?select=id,displayName&filter=displayName eq 'Mgmt-DPortGroup'
   ```

![API to get network ID for VM](/img/api-to-get-the-network-id.png)

6. After I obtained all the values that were required to build the request body to recover a cloud recovery point from `“0-Linux-Demo-VM02"`, I constructed the JSON request body as shown in the below figure. To restore the recovery point into a new virtual machine, the `restoreType` key of the request body JSON structure was set to `“ALTERNATE”` as shown in the below figure. I also provided the new virtual machine name after the recovery a﻿s `“0-Linux-Demo-VN02-2-05-04-2024_05:48_PM”`. The [API](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/backup-recovery/public/openapi/backup-recovery-public-v1beta1/operation/VirtualMachineRestore/) used for this:  

   ```shellsession
   POST /backup-recovery/v1beta1/virtual-machines/{{vmId}}/restore
   ```

![API to recover a cloud protection copy from a VM](/img/api-restoring-a-cloud-protection-recovery-point.png)

7. To validate that the recovery was completed, I tracked the progress from the response using the `async-operations` [API](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/data-services/public/openapi/data-services-public-v1beta1/operation/GetAsyncOperation/) based on `{{taskId}}` from previous execution as shown below. The API used for this:

   ```shellsession
   GET /data-services/v1beta1/async-operations/:id?select=associatedResources,createdAt,endedAt,error,displayName,healthStatus,id,customerId,progressPercent,name,type,state
   ```

![Task Id confirming the completion of the recovery](/img/task-display-recovery-is-completed.png)

8. At the end, I went to the V﻿Mware vCenter console u﻿sed in this example to validate that the virtual machine 0-Linux-Demo-VN02-2-05-04-2024_05:48_PM was indeed part of the virtual machines inventory.

## Summary

This blog post introduces the new set of REST API from the family of the APIs for data services on HPE Greenlake, namely **HPE GreenLake API for Backup and Recovery**. This set of APIs is documented at the HPE GreenLake for developer [website](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake/services/backup-recovery/public/) using interactive documentation based on OpenAPI Standard version 3.1. 

Early in this blog post, I laid down the relationship of the resources in this set of HPE GreenLake APIs with the objects in the HPE GreenLake Backup and Recovery user interface. In this blog post, I also introduced the examples from several use cases associated with utilizing HPE GreenLake for Backup and Recovery to provide virtual machine protection from day one.

The examples presented in this blog post provided some guides on using combination of the REST APIs that were announced in March 2024 to achieve the goal for protecting a virtual machine.

All the execution for the examples were done using Postman API tool without any scripting language to encourage anyone to experiment with the family of REST APIs for data services on HPE GreenLake. 

Please don’t hesitate to explore this new set of APIs for Cloud Data Services on HPE GreenLake and see how you can improve your agility in managing your data.
