In the first [article](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/willing-to-build-up-your-own-workshops-on-demand-infrastructure/) of this series, I described the reasons behind the decision to open source our Workshops-on-Demand (WoD) project and gave you a comprehensive picture of the project's overall infrastructure. In this second article, I will cover the backend part of the project and explain how to deploy it.

The overall infrastructure can run on physical servers or VMs. We usually designate one server for the frontend and a second server for the backend. You could also decide to separate every single component of each side.

## H﻿ow to deploy your own backend...

A﻿s explained in the previous [article](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/willing-to-build-up-your-own-workshops-on-demand-infrastructure/), the project is split into multiple repositories from the architectural and public / private aspects. The architecture is divided between the frontend and backend. The project admins will need to decide whether they are willing to develop and propose public-only content to the participants or add any proprietary and private content.

I﻿ will start with the simpliest scenario: A public-only approach. Then we will dive into the specificities related the private approach.

### P﻿ublic-only Deployment: No private backend nor private workshops

**Important Note:**  

**T﻿his part is compulsory for any type of deployment. Public only or public + private.**

F﻿irst, you need a repository to clone. The Workshops-on-Demand GitHub projects can be found [here](https://github.com/Workshops-on-Demand/). W﻿e have packaged the solution in several Github repos. Each repository handles a specific role in the overall architecture.

Here's a quick look at what can be found in each:

![](/img/wod-blogserie2-repos.png "WOD Repositories")

**[w﻿od-notebooks](https://github.com/Workshops-on-Demand/wod-notebooks):** Public Workshops-on-Demand based on Jupyter Notebooks.

* You can test them live at <https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshops>

**[w﻿od-install](https://github.com/Workshops-on-Demand/wod-install):** Installer part of the Workshops-on-Demand project.

**[w﻿od-backend](https://github.com/Workshops-on-Demand/wod-backend):** Back-end part of our Workshops-on-Demand setup. 

**[w﻿od-frontend](https://github.com/Workshops-on-Demand/wod-frontend):** Frontend part of the Workshops-on-Demand project.

* Based on NGINX and NodeJS technologies, it provides the participtants' Registration Portal used to enable booking of the workshops.

**[w﻿od-api-db](https://github.com/Workshops-on-Demand/wod-api-db):** Workshops-on-Demand registration portal application

* Open API 3.0 based api used to manage the Workshops-on-Demand project. It also provides a database hosting the different status of participants, workshops, and students. 

**[w﻿od-private](https://github.com/Workshops-on-Demand/wod-private):** Example Private configuration for Workshops-on-Demand (WoD).

**[w﻿od-frontend-private](https://github.com/Workshops-on-Demand/wod-frontend-private):** Private Frontend part of the Workshops-on-Demand project.

**[w﻿od-api-db-private](https://github.com/Workshops-on-Demand/wod-api-db-private):** Workshops-on-Demand registration portal application

* This provide examples for creating your own cutomization layer on top of the public standard WoD Backend / wod Notebooks content. Do not put any confidential data here as this is a public repository!

**Note**: T﻿here are now 7 repositories available for now. 

![](/img/wod-blogserie2-2repos.png "Workshops-on-Demand repositories")

It provides:

* An Installer allowing you to install either Backend, Api-DB server, or Frontend using a single line of command.
* A complete JupyterHub server with some addons (additional Jupyterhub kernels, Ansible galaxies, and PowerShell libraries) on your system, ready to host Workshops-on-Demand that you can find here. 
* A postfix server used for the procmail API 
* An Ansible engine to allow automation 
* A fail2ban service 
* An Admin user to manage everything 
* A set of scripts to handle different tasks such as: 

  * Notebooks deployment
  * Jupyterhub compliancy
  * Users compliancy
  * Security Management

#### Backend server preparation:

B﻿efore cloning the backend repository, you will need to prepare the server that will host the backend features. When ready, you will proceed with the cloning and then the installation process.

##### Prerequesites:

In order to setup the backend server, you will need:

* A fresh OS install on physical / virtualized server running Ubuntu 24.04 or Centos 7.9 leveraging any deployment mechanism of your choice.(e.g. iLO, vagrant, etc.). You may even use this vagrant file to automatically generate a complete setup leveraging vagrant, libvirt and QEMU/KVM. 
* A Linux account with sudo priviledges on your Linux distro. Name it `install`   

**Note**: In order to support 100 concurrent users, you need:    

* 2 cpus or more machine
* 128 GB of RAM 
* 500 GB of storage 

We are currently using an HPE ProLiant DL360 Gen10 server on our different production sites.

When done with OS installation and preparation

* From the WoD-backend server (aka JupyterHub server), as the install user, you will need to clone the wod-install repo first.

```shellsession
install$ git clone https://github.com/Workshops-on-Demand/wod-install.git
install$ cd wod-install/
```

* Examine default installation parameters and adapt when necessary accordingly. Files are self-documented.

Look at the following files within ansible/group_vars directory.    

* `all.yml` file  

```shellsession
vi all.yml

 S﻿ee the example below for a backend server.  

### B﻿ackend installation process:

The installation process is handled by a dedicated repo : wod-install. This repo needs to be cloned on every single machine  constituting the wod architecture.

The wod installer allows through a single command to install either a backend, an api-db server, or a frontend.


[](https://github.com/Workshops-on-Demand/wod-backend/blob/main/INSTALL.md#for-private-based-workshops-on-demand-private-backend--private-workshops-or-if-you-need-to-modify-defaults)O﻿nce you are done with the files, you can can proceed with the installation itself. T﻿he installation is based on a common install script [install.sh ](https://github.com/Workshops-on-Demand/wod-backend/blob/main/install/install.sh)that allows the deployment of the different parts of the solution. It can be called as follows:

`install.sh [-h][-t type][-g groupname][-b backend][-f frontend][-a api-db][-e external][-u user][-s sender]`

`-﻿h` provides the help

`install.sh` performs the following tasks:

* Calls the `install-system-<< distribution name >>.sh` script      
* Installs minimal required (`ansible, git, jq, openssh server, npm`)
* Creates an admin user as defined upper (default is `wodadmin`) with sudo rights
* Calls the `install-system-common.sh` script that performs the following tasks:

  * Cleanup    
  * Github repos cloning (leveraging install.repo file) : public Backend and public Private repos    
  * Create ssh keys for wodadmin    
  * Creates GROUPNAME variables    
  * Creates Ansible inventory files  
* Calls the `install_system.sh` script with the type (backend, frontend, etc..) that performs the following tasks:    

  * Install the necessary stack based on selected type    
  * Create a `wod.sh` script in `wod-backend` directory to be used by all other scripts    
  * Source the `wod.sh` file     
  * Setup Ansible-galaxies (`community.general` and `posix`)     
  * Setup Ansible and call the playbook `install_<type>.yml` followed by the `ansible\_check\_<type>.yml`    

At the end of the installation process:

* you will have a JupyterHub server running on port 8000    
* You will get a new `wodadmin` user (Default admin)    
* You will get a set of 20 students (Default value)    

A﻿ll playbooks are self-documented. Please check for details.

W﻿e leave it to you to handle the necessary port redirection and SSL certificates management when needed. In our case, we went for a simple yet efficient solution based on an OPNSense Firewall along with a HAProxy setup to manage ports'redirection, HTTP to HTTPS Redirection, SSL Certificates. The backend also includes a Fail2ban service for login security management.

At this point, you should be able to access your JupyterHub environment with a few pre-installed set of kernels like `Bash, Python, ansible, ssh, PowerShell`.

Y﻿ou can then start developing new notebooks for your public based environment. And if you don't know how to do this, I will explain how in my next article

If you need to develop private content that cannot be shared with the wider Open Source Community because of dedicated IP, the next section in this article will explain how to handle this.

### **How to handle private-content based Workshops-on-Demand**

#### *(private backend + private workshops on top of default public backend and notebooks)*

T﻿he principle remains similar, with a few differences explained below.

* Y﻿ou will start by forking the following public private [repo](https://github.com/Workshops-on-Demand/wod-private.git) on Github under your own Github account (we will refer to it as `Account`).    
* Next, clone the forked repo.    
* Edit the `all.yml` and `<groupname>` files to customize your setup. T﻿his variable `<groupname>` defines possible backend server in your environement. By default, the project comes with a sample working file named `production` in `ansible/group-vars`. But you could have multiple. In our case, we have defined `sandbox`, `test`, `staging` and several `production` files, all defining a different backend environment. These files will be used to override the default values specified by the public version delivered as part of the default public installation.    
* Commit and push changes to your repo.    
* Create an `install.priv` file located in `install` directory when using a private repo (consider looking at [install.repo](https://github.com/Workshops-on-Demand/wod-backend/blob/main/install/install.repo) file for a better understanding of the variables).
* Define the WODPRIVREPO and WODPRIVBRANCH variables as follows:    

  * `WODPRIVBRANCH="main"`     
  * `WODPRIVREPO="git@github.com:Account/Private-Repo.git wod-private"`    

**Note:** When using a token

Please refer to the following [url](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to generate a `token` file in `install` directory of WoD-backend:

* Edit the `install.priv` file located in `install` directory of WoD-backend:  

  * Create line before variable declaration: ``token=`cat $EXEPATH/token` ``    
  * Use the token in the url WODPRIVREPO="git clone https://user:$token@github.com/Account/wod-private.git wod-private"    

Y﻿ou are now ready to perform the installation again to support a private repository. 

Please note that this setup phase can be concurrent with the public setup phase. Indeed, the install script should detect the presence of the private repository owing to the presence of the install.priv file. It will automatically adjust the different scripts and variables to add the relevant content. It will actually overload some of the variables with private ones.

Y﻿ou now have a working Workshops-on-Demand backend server in place. Congratulations! The next article in the series will help you better understand the lifecycle of the backend server. How does a workshop registration work from the backend server 's side? How do you manage this server on a daily basis? How and when do you need to update it ? All these questions will be answered in the next article. And from there, we will move to the frontend side of things and finally to a workshop's creation process.
