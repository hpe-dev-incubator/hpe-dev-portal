The HPE DEV team is excited to present its revamped [HPE Developer Community web portal](https://developer.hpe.com/) Featuring a fresh look and feel with easier navigation, it provides the resources you need to design and build software experiences that harness the most value from your data. With a new backend system and new design, it’s easier to use and contribute to. In addition, we’re delighted to be able to share our new Twitter handle with you, @HPE_DEV, a simplification many of you have requested.

## A rich set of tools

A key area of the portal is our Platforms section. Here, you can find APIs, GitHub repositories, and many of the other resources we make available for developers, designers, data scientists, and architects.
