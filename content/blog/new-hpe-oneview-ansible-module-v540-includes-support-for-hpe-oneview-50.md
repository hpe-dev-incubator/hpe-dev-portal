[HPE OneView](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/software.html) offers a software-defined, programmatic approach to managing infrastructure with efficient workflow automation, a modern RESTful API, and a comprehensive partner ecosystem. HPE’s software development kits (SDKs) and modules enable HPE OneView to integrate with partner products and take advantage of the benefits they offer.

HPE is pleased to announce the availability of the HPE OneView Ansible Module v5.4.0. This module provides integration of HPE OneView with Ansible by Red Hat®, an industry-leading software deployment, provisioning, and configuration management tool. This new module supports HPE OneView 5.0 (REST API version 1200). It also provides backwards compatibility, extending support to API 800 and API 1000. 

The HPE OneView Ansible module enables the automated provisioning of bare-metal resources, including servers, storage, and networking as part of the application deployment process. Using Ansible with HPE OneView allows customers to create a flexible and adaptive infrastructure, essential to addressing the need for organizational agility and supporting initiatives that accelerate the delivery of customer and business value.
