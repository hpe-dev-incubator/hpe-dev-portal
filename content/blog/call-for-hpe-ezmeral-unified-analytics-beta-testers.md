The HPE Ezmeral team has been hard at work creating the next generation analytics and advanced analytics platform. To give you an early look at what we’ve been up to, we have created the [HPE Ezmeral Early Access (EEA) program](https://connect.hpe.com/HPEEzmeralEarlyAccess) that lets developers try new products, capabilities and features before they’re released. 

**Building out a more robust HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics**

HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics is a packaged offering that contains best-of-breed open-source tools, including data analytics tools like Apache Spark and Presto, data visualization tools like Apache Superset, data engineering tools like Airflow and Great Expectations, and data science tools like Kubeflow, MLflow, and Feast. These open-source packages are generally better than any proprietary solutions on the market and are also fully supported by HPE as part of HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics. HPE’s open-source packages are also pre-integrated. Integration can be one of the biggest challenges of consuming open-source solutions. Our work at the data/feature layer radically simplifies your overall solution without compromising the benefits of using 100% open-source API’s. In addition to framework integration, we have also spent time securing these components out-of-the-box, removing yet another headache.

HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics is also a hybrid and multi-cloud solution that will run everywhere you want it to run. It can be installed on-premises, at the edge, or in a public cloud. Our next-gen HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics product can be installed and ready to use in under 10 minutes. The built-in global namespace will allow you to easily connect multiple unified analytics workloads and data fabrics to share compute and data across different clouds and different workflows.

Finally, HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics is an opinionated set of software, meaning that HPE has selected the most important open-source products in data engineering, data analytics, and data science. However, we don’t expect our customers to always choose all of our tools, so we designed our workflows and pipelines to allow easy replacement of an included component with an alternative. We provide a comprehensive selection of products, but we also try to stay out of your way if you have preferences. For example, while we include Apache Superset for building reports and dashboards, if you prefer to use Tableau, our JDBC Presto API’s are available for a quick swap. If you prefer using Weights and Bias’, you can swap out our MLflow registry solution. Models can be published to Kserve or Sagemaker Endpoints.

As part of the EEA program, you will have access to an HPE Ezmeral Unified Analytics environment hosted on HPE infrastructure. We will provide you with initial training to get you up to speed on the various open-source frameworks that are included. We will also provide you [a Slack channel](https://hpedev.slack.com/archives/C043WNNHFKL) for support questions. During and immediately after the test period, we will request feedback informally and through surveys. Your feedback will be critical in helping ensure our product roadmap continues to evolve with our customers’ needs.
