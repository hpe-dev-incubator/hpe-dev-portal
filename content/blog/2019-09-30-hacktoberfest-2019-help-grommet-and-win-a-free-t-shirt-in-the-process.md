Are you a developer looking to help drive the growth of open source software and make positive contributions to the ever-growing Grommet community? Are you a fan of [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io/) and have ideas on some features you’d like to see? Well, here’s your chance to contribute and get a free t-shirt in the process!

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration run by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and [DEV design](https://dev.to/) aimed at encouraging coders worldwide to contribute to open source software. It is open to all backgrounds and skill levels, from experienced developers to students just learning to code.

To participate, all you have to do is sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31 and submit four [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) to any public GitHub repositories. To contribute to Grommet, access any of the Grommet issues in the Hacktoberfest challenge by going to the [Grommet GitHub Repo.](https://github.com/grommet/grommet/labels/hacktoberfest)

For specifics on the event, including rules and details on how to get your t-shirt, go to the [Hacktoberfest 2019 home page.](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)
