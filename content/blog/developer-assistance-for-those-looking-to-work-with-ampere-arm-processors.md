The HPE ProLiant RL300 Gen11 is renowned as a best-in-class compute platform for cloud-native workloads. Part of what makes it so special is its use of the Ampere® Arm processors. Many of today’s progressive, open-source-centric customers are quickly pivoting to these AArch64 processors for the predictable performance they deliver at the scale required for cloud processing. Others are still looking for assistance on how to make the transition from x86.

We recently published a couple of blog posts on the HPE Developer Community portal that provide some assistance. The first, [Simplifying code migration: The benefits of the new Ampere Porting Advisor for x86 to ARM64](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/simplifying-code-migration-the-benefits-of-the-new-ampere-porting-advisor-for-x86-to-arm64/), describes a new open-source software porting advisor that promises to simplify the porting process. Another post introduces the [Ampere Performance Toolkit](https://amperecomputing.com/blogs/ampere-performance-toolkit-announcement), which provides an automated way to run and benchmark important application data.

In our research on how to best assist developers in dealing with these processors, we came across the [Ampere Developer Program for the Cloud Computing Community](https://amperecomputing.com/blogs/ampere-launches-developer-program-for-the-cloud-computing-community). On this site, you’ll find:

* Porting and tuning utilities
* Developer outreach technical documents and resources
* Customer quick start guides
* And resources for every stage of development

We understand that this site will continue to expand to include things like:

* Workload briefs
* Transition and tuning guides
* Reference architectures
* Developer blog posts
* Tutorials
* And case studies

If you’re developing on any HPE systems that are using the Ampere ARM processor, you may wish to consult this Ampere Developer Program for more resources.
