## [GLPCE's Features](<>)

**Flexible Resource Allocation:** Enables targeted allocation and freeing up of computing instance types from a fungible Infrastructure Resource Pool based on demand.

**Prevention of Bottlenecks:** With GLPCE, you can adjust the resources given to each service based on the present needs of utilization, ensuring smooth operation, and preventing potential service interruptions or slowdowns.

**Cost-awareness:** GLPCE's Consumption Analytics Service provides clear insight into both private and public cloud costs. Admins can easily compare expenses, monitor capacity, and analyze spend by service, location, or unit, streamlining budget allocation and chargeback processes.

[Allocation / Deallocation](<>)

GLPCE prioritizes resource allocation in line with expected workloads. Should a cluster harbor idle resources, they can be redirected to areas of higher demand. Through consumption analytics and continuous monitoring, optimal utilization is ensured. We'll delve deeper into this concept with a forthcoming visual representation

**Resource Allocation Strategy:**  

**Initial Allocation**: As seen in screenshot 1, the initial resource allocation process is primarily based on anticipated workload demands. 

![Screenshot 1: Initial Allocation](/img/picture1.png "Screenshot 1: Initial Allocation")

When expecting extensive data-processing tasks, the system designates a higher number of memory optimized (M2i) instance types to Cluster 2, situated within the virtualization resource pool. On the other hand, for every day, routine operations, Cluster 1 is typically outfitted with general purpose (G2i) instance types to ensure smooth and efficient operations. This allocation strategy aims to match resource types with the specific requirements of each cluster.


**Reallocation**: Drawing attention to screenshot 2, it's evident that as workloads ebb and flow, there may be instances within the Bare Metal resource pool that remain unused. Such idle resources aren't just dormant assets; they have potential. 

![Screenshot 2: Reallocation](/img/picture2.png "Screenshot 2: Reallocation")

As depicted in screenshot 2, these instance types can be promptly and efficiently reallocated to any of the virtualization clusters, contingent on their immediate demands. This dynamic reallocation ensures that resources are always optimally utilized, adapting in real-time to the ever-changing workload requirements.

**Tune Resource Allocations:** 

* **Monitoring for Efficiency/Capacity**: Continuously monitor the utilization rates across all three services: Bare Metal, virtual machines, and containers. To understand how such resource utilization is tracked and assessed, stay tuned for our upcoming section on Capacity Planning and Monitoring

![Screenshot 3: Responsive Adjustments](/img/picture4.png "Screenshot 3: Responsive Adjustments")

* **Responsive Adjustments**:  Referring to Screenshots 3 and 4, observe that if Cluster 2 possesses idle memory optimized (M2i) instances, they can be shifted from Cluster 2 either to the Bare Metal pool or to Cluster 1, depending on demand. Conversely, if Cluster 1 has surplus general purpose (G2i) units, they can be relocated in a similar manner. Such adaptability ensures that resources are consistently maximized, preventing them from sitting unused when they could be beneficial elsewhere.

  **Capacity Planning & Monitoring**

  Plan and monitor capacity usage in PCE across the 3 services.

   

  ![Screenshot 2: Bare Metal Service Monitoring](/img/picture5.png "Screenshot 2: Bare Metal Service Monitoring")

  In Screenshot 2, the Capacity tab displays Bare metal resources categorized by "Compute Group, Site, and Instance Type." Users can set thresholds for CPU and memory usage. Yellow bars in the CPU and memory columns signify that resource usage is nearing the configured maximum threshold.

  ![Screenshot 3: Virtual Machine Service Monitoring](/img/picture6.png "Screenshot 3: Virtual Machine Service Monitoring")

  In Screenshot 3, the Capacity tab categorizes Virtual Machine service resources by "Cluster and Instance Type." The screen displays four key metrics: CPU usage, CPU allocated, memory usage, and memory allocated. 

  ·     CPU and memory usage thresholds reflect active resource consumption by hosted apps/processes. By defining a range, we can optimize resources, preventing underuse or potential performance issues.

  ·       CPU and memory allocated thresholds show reserved resources per cluster/instance type, regardless of activity. This ensures we identify over-allocated or under-allocated resources.

  ![Screenshot 4: Container Service Monitoring](/img/picture7.png "Screenshot 4: Container Service Monitoring")

  In Screenshot 4, the Capacity tab displays grouping of Container resources by "Cluster, Instance Type, and Site." PCE supports two container deployment models: on Virtual Machines and on Bare Metal. While allocated thresholds are predetermined, this interface allows for the customization of usage thresholds. Stay tuned for our upcoming section on Container service scaling.
