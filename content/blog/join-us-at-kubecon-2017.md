# HPE is at KubeCon

KubeCon 2017 is here! This time Linux Foundation is organizing both Kubecon and CloudNativeCon together in Austin Convention Center, Austin TX December 6-8. KubeCon + CloudNativeCon gathers all CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) projects under one roof. Leading vendors and technologists from open source cloud native communities are attending KubeCon 2017 to further the advancement of cloud native computing.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) has realigned its business focus to make hybrid IT simple. It wants to help customers create a hybrid IT model that streamlines day-to-day IT operations and accelerate their digital transformation. HPE's major initiatives and recent product launches such as the new HPE Developer Community Portal, HPE OneSphere, HPE Synergy, HPE SimpliVity HyperConverged solutions, HPE InfoSight predictive analytics, and other solutions reinforce that vision towards its support for Cloud Native Computing.

Given HPE’s commitment to Cloud Native Computing and specifically advancement and integration of Kubernetes and other container solutions in our product and services, HPE has joined CNCF as a silver member and will be participating in KubeCon as a sponsor. At KubeCon2017 kicking off today, HPE will be highlighting: 
1. The new HPE Developer Community Portal 
2. HPE OneSphere – a SaaS based Multi-Cloud Management solution 
3. HPE’s contribution to Kubernetes Project Dory

HPE Developer Community Portal is being announced at KubeCon 2017.

HPE OneSphere is an as-a-service multi-cloud management platform that simplifies management of multi-cloud environments and on-premises infrastructure. Through a unified view, IT can compose hybrid clouds capable of supporting both traditional and cloud-native applications and offers cost analytics across on-premises and off-premises cloud consumption. It provides a simple VM and Container Vending capability allowing developers to focus on developing solutions instead of worrying about deploying VMs and containers.

HPE Project Dory is an Open Source project led by HPE. HPE Dory is an Open Source FlexVolume Driver that allows use of any storage to persist data for Kubernetes. Dory works with any storage that has a Docker Volume Driver. It manages data with Kubernetes and platforms such as OpenShift and dynamically provision persistent volumes with Kubernetes storage classes.
