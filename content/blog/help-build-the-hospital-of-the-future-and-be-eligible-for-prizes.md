Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), the multinational enterprise information technology company based in Houston, Texas,  is proud to partner with [Texas Children’s Hospital](https://www.texaschildrens.org/departments/us-news-world-report), one of the top-ranked children’s hospitals in the US, in its [inaugural innovation-focused hackathon](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/texas-childrens-hospital-healthcare-hackathon/). To celebrate the groundbreaking of its new hospital, Texas Children’s is hosting a two-week long [virtual Healthcare Hackathon](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/texas-childrens-hospital-healthcare-hackathon/) from May 14th through May 24th, 2021. This virtual event is designed to inspire and draw attention to the need for new ways of thinking and the use of technology in healthcare in treatments for women and children.

Through this hackathon, the hospital is seeking innovative ideas that incorporate technology to address its biggest day-to-day challenges. Showcase your innovative, tech-based solutions to win awesome prizes! Coders are encouraged to work individually or in teams of 2-5 people to build solutions that align to one or more of the following [themes](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/texas-childrens-hospital-healthcare-hackathon/):

* **Food Service and Delivery** – How do we reimagine the food service and delivery experience to ensure patients, families, employees and guests get the nutritious meals they need?
* **Meeting People Where They Are** – How do we transform traditional hospital experiences/processes so they are more convenient, personalized, and equitable?
* **Touchless Experience** – How can we convert physical interactions into touchless, yet still personal and trustworthy, digital healthcare experiences?
* **AR/VR in Hospitals** – How can we implement extended reality experiences (XR) to reimagine the doctor/patient experience, training, and patient/family/care team communication and coordination?
* **Evolution of the Child Life Experience** – What innovative experiences can Child Life specialists use to help patients and their families cope, connect, socialize, and heal? 

## **For Kids By Kids**

As part of the hackathon, Texas Children’s is offering a special category exclusively for coders under 18 years of age called [For Kids By Kids](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/texas-childrens-hospital-healthcare-hackathon/custom-tab/for-kids-by-kids/#For%20Kids%20By%20Kids).  Using Scratch, a free visual programming language that’s designed to teach kids how to program through drag and drop blocks of code, young coders are invited to animate patient journey’s at Texas Children’s Hospital. Examples of a patient’s journey include [what to expect when being discharged from the hospital](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/he-public-data/discharge-pathw_081420187d3b3ef.pdf) or what to expect when going to see your pediatrician. Please note that coding classes and camps are welcome! Once done with the animation, a recording of the animation and/or any Scratch code the young developer would like to share should be submitted for the judges’ evaluation.

## **Judging**

Submissions are due by May 24, 2021 11:55 PM CDT. Every submission will be evaluated by a panel of Texas Children’s Hospital experts and at least one of their sponsors, who include HPE, NVIDIA, Mark III Systems, the Butler Bros., Google Cloud, T-Mobile for Business, Unity, and HEB Digital. Winners will be announced on June 9th, 2021. There are up to $10,000 USD in prizes to be given away, including an NVIDIA Shield and leather duffle bags. Time is short!
