## Meet you in the Hack Shack!

The HPE DEV Community Hack Shack is a virtual experience designed to help developers, designers, and data scientists connect with the HPE DEV team and collaborate with them to build innovative solutions. It provides a place where you can engage with experts to learn about HPE and open source solutions and work with them to guide product development. At physical events, the Hack Shack was known for its unique, informal and fun atmosphere. Our online virtual experience aims to bring this same feeling to this virtual event!

At the [KubeCon | CloudNativeCon EU](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) HPE virtual booth, you’ll get to explore HPE’s different software-enabling and application development technologies, including:

* [The HPE Ezmeral Container Platform](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/solutions/container-platform.html), the industry’s first Kubernetes container platform software designed to run both cloud-native and non cloud-native applications, enabling true hybrid cloud operations across any location. 
* [The intelligent data platform](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/storage/intelligent-storage.html?chatsrc=ot-en&jumpid=ps_8r5mdg32xs_aid-520023673&gclid=Cj0KCQiAs67yBRC7ARIsAF49CdU6O6Hbaj1lwT8tcrU702BzRnZboWNQILTShb0cCk-eEk7nUjQ-yhMaAv4fEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) from [HPE storage](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/storage.html), focused on persistent storage use cases for Kubernetes in private, public, and hybrid clouds and how to enable CI/CD pipelines. 
* [The SPIFFE and SPIRE Projects](https://spiffe.io/). With the recent acquisition of Scytale, HPE is the leading contributor for CNCF’s SPIFFE and SPIRE projects. These projects help organizations build a foundation for zero trust through the use of platform agnostic, cryptographic service identity. 

## Sessions outside the booth at KubeCon | CloudNativeCon EU

[KubeCon | CloudNativeCon EU](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) will also offer two sessions highlighting HPE offerings:

* **Predictable Performance Through Prometheus and Performance Aware Scheduling**, co-sponsored by HPE and Intel and delivered by Chief Technologist, Tom Golway (HPE), and Software Engineer, Killian Muldoon (Intel)
* **Taming Data/State Challenges for ML Applications and Kubeflow**, presented by HPE Distinguished Technologist, Skyler Thomas

Virtual events can be challenging. Many who attend physical conferences come specifically to engage personally with industry and subject matter experts. That’s why the [HPE DEV community](https://developer.hpe.com/community) has worked hard to deliver its [HPE DEV Community Hack Shack] (/hackshack) virtual experience. We want to ensure you have a place where you can do just that. For questions or help, be sure to connect with us on our [HPE DEV Slack Channel](https://slack.hpedev.io/).
