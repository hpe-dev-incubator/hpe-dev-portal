Building the infrastructure required for AI solutions can be an expensive and daunting undertaking. That’s why an as-a-Service option makes so much sense. With NVIDIA AI Enterprise now available through HPE GreenLake in select countries, developers can quickly get started building high-performing AI solutions, using the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite – an end-to-end, cloud-native suite of AI and data analytics software that can be deployed anywhere from the data center to the cloud. 


Announced this past June, the service offers NVIDIA AI Enterprise on NVIDIA-Certified HPE ProLiant DL380 and DL385 servers running VMware vSphere with Tanzu on a pay-per-use basis that can be tailored to the needs of the organization. Customers can select from predefined packages that include management of infrastructure and software and add on optional AI advisory and solution workshops.
