This October 24-28, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation will once again be hosting its flagship conference – [KubeCon+CloudNativeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/) – as a hybrid event. Take this opportunity to meet with thousands of cloud-native leaders, including gold-sponsor Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), as the community gathers to further the education and advancement of cloud native computing. This is an important event for HPE as it offers us the opportunity to further educate the community on our expertise and support of open source and cloud native technologies.

### Have some Kubist fun and learn something in the process

HPE subject matter experts representing SPIFFE/SPIRE, HPE Storage, Determined AI, HPE Ezmeral, Zerto and HPE PointNext will be available in person to answer questions and offer demos at Booth #G13. Come to:

* Learn about the cloud-native data infrastructure portfolio from HPE and how to accelerate delivery of the most demanding stateful workloads on Kubernetes.
* Get advice on advanced use cases involving data management, business transformations, and why persistent storage matters for app developers.
* Discuss fully open-source machine learning (ML) model training. Learn how to get started, discuss current trends in the ML ecosystem, and join the community.
* Understand how HPE Pointnext can help you in your multi-cloud journey and transform monolithic to containerized, cloud-native workloads.

You’re going to want to stay and pay attention to these talks, because our magical master of ceremonies will be quizzing you at the end. Be the first one to correctly answer the questions and you’ll come away with either a Rubik’s Cube or one of our cool wooden puzzles.

Each day, we’ll also be giving away a Raspberry Pi Starter Kit. Booth visitors who get scanned in the booth will be given a raffle ticket and, at the end of the last presentation of each day, we will draw the winner of the prize.

### Join us in celebrating the graduation of SPIFFE/SPIRE!

Contributing alongside the many leading technology companies who were a part of this project, like VMWare, Uber, ByteDance, Anthem, Transferwise, IBM, etc., HPE is really excited that SPIFFE/SPIRE has just been designated a Graduated project of CNCF. Leading and influencing meaningful innovation in the Open Source community is important to us, as it provides key capabilities that our customers desire and helps us design solutions that meet their needs.

Make sure you stop by the booth to talk with some of our SPIFFE/SPIRE experts, like Andrew Jessup, to learn more about what it can do for you. We’ll be giving out several copies of “Solving the Bottom Turtle” as part of our celebration.

### Ahoy, developers… join us virtually and seek out your cache!

As part of our virtual presence, we’ll be hosting several Office Hours designed for developers, data scientists, and data/ML engineers to hear more about what HPE offers for them. [Tune in](https://kubecon-cloudnativecon-na.com/virtual-exhibitor/?v4b4342b0f72f3260e37d74de68eab433fee0c641d933e76d52be7eb34b211371656f07b5a54b2e522db3ac7b27c7d555=068E4EDFD2D581C2C838CEEFD5F655754F523A6864305A1184BF01DD527B60FB0740D3F17B594A1732C891BBBA3213A8) for:

* The HPE Developer Community team’s session on ***What? Not yet an HPE Developer Community member? There’s treasure to be found!***, guiding you through the rich set of resources HPE offers developers through our web portal.
* The HPE Ezmeral engineering group’s talk on ***HPE Ezmeral Early Access***, a beta program that allows developers to try new products before they’re released. With exemplary training and support provided by HPE, developers will get hands-on experience with new features and capabilities.

The HPE Developer Community team will also be hosting a Virtual Treasure Hunt. This is a popular game that we’ve held at several past events that gets updated with new questions every time. Twelve players who complete the Virtual Treasure Hunt will be selected as winners of a $50 e-gift card to be redeemed at the HPE-branded merchandise e-store. Completing the Virtual Treasure Hunt requires participants to explore the HPE Developer Community’s rich ecosystem and submit their entry via the Virtual Treasure Hunt form during the event. Refer to the giveaway [Terms and Conditions](https://developer.hpe.com/hackshack/treasurehunt-terms-conditions/) for complete program details.

### We’ve always got something going on in this space

HPE has been a proud sponsor of KubeCon+CloudNativeCon for years. We’re excited to be able to share with you the key activities HPE is involved with in the areas of Kubernetes and other open source technologies. Make sure you stop by our booth, either virtually or physically. We’re always happy to engage with you.
