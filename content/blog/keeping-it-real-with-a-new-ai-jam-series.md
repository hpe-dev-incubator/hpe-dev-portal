It wasn’t that long ago we used to say “Artificial Intelligence". Now we just say A.I. These words are so pervasive in conversation that we are now down to the acronym. But what I have been hearing is that companies are completely scattered on the topic. Some are launching experiments on the talent and technologies they have been maturing for years; others are scrambling to get in the game. Despite this, everyone is asking "how do I get started" or "how do I move quickly" right now. That’s why the HPE Developer Community is sponsoring a new series of Skill Up meetings called “[Get real with AI](https://developer.hpe.com/campaign/get-real-with-ai-jam-series/)” to help you. We want to get past the hype and bring you technical and business value that meets you where you are today. So, let’s just say “keep calm and get real with AI.”

## Responding to requests for more help

Earlier this year, we held a workshop that focused on the basics companies need to successfully host and deploy AI projects. The success of this one workshop resulted in a clamor for more sessions on this same topic. We quickly came to realize that we needed a new series of interactive sessions that were a lot more basic in nature. And many of the subject matter experts we spoke with wanted to share more of their ideas and experiences about where and how to get started. 

This resulted in the premier of our first AI Jam session titled Exploring Transformative AI Use Cases Across Industries. The discussion brought together thought leaders, industry experts, and technologists who talked through transformative AI use cases across diverse sectors, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and retail.

It turned out to be a very interactive and useful session with panelists sharing their insights on the critical factors for AI adoption, including data management, ethical considerations, and integration with existing systems. The discussion also highlighted emerging trends, such as the use of AI for predictive analytics, personalization, automation, and decision-making. If you missed this session you can catch the [replay here](https://developer.hpe.com/campaign/get-real-with-ai-jam-series/). 

## Keeping it real in our next session

It was a good start. Going forward, we decided it was best to continue keeping it well aligned and focused on “keeping it real with AI” basics. To do that, we needed to change up the next session to focus on – “Cool AI Use Case, Now What?”. 

I hear a lot about people coming up with great ideas where AI technologies could help their business. But as quickly as an idea is floated, all eyes go towards the technologist, the data scientists, and the IT operations teams, and leadership comes back saying “sounds good, now show me something.” At that point it can get complicated, as many people don’t know where to get started or what’s really needed to show success. That’s what we’re going to focus on in the next AI jam session. We’ll be discussing best practices on getting started with AI and illustrate shortcuts on how to get AI projects from data experiments to AI deployments. If this is something you might be interested in, don’t forget to register for the October 2nd AI jam session at 10.00 (CST).

And yes, there’s more to come, so please be sure to check in on the new upcoming [AI jam series](https://developer.hpe.com/campaign/get-real-with-ai-jam-series/) that we will be running in November and December. See you there!
