Simple, consistent, and thoughtfully designed user interfaces (UI) can go a long way to integrating business applications and streamlining operations. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is a huge proponent of simplifying complex environments. That’s why HPE developed [Grommet,](http://v2.grommet.io) an open source UI development tool, and made it available to anyone looking to create consistent user experiences for their applications. 

When I first started working with the Chief Design Office at HPE, I was very excited for the opportunity to learn more about Grommet. Design is playing a bigger part in computing applications today. To me, Grommet is like the glue that binds function and design together. As evidenced by input received through [HPE DEV](http://developer.hpe.com)  and several tradeshows and events, Grommet is both liked and used, sustained by a vibrant, grassroots community. It has attracted plenty of developer input with over 4,000 commits from a wide variety of different contributors. 

For those of you unfamiliar with Grommet, it is a library of reusable UI components for developers and designers. Grommet makes the application creation process both agile and easy. It does so by offering developers commonly used interface elements in a Node package and delivering them as building blocks to create web applications. It also gives designers a full library of design assets and templates. Grommet uses React as an underlying technology to help deliver its modularity and adds accessibility, responsiveness, and theming.

Grommet works using a mobile-first strategy in combination with a task-based design approach. Its components offer nothing more and nothing less than what’s required to complete a task, while still being flexible enough to customize and tailor it to your own needs. 

Grommet’s libraries give both designers and developers a way to collaborate and inject consistent user experiences into their applications easily. It offers ready-to-use layouts, type, colors, controls, and mechanisms to incorporate and present content.

Grommet is used by both internal HPE and external developers to build enterprise-class and consumer-grade applications that can be used in web, desktop, and mobile-friendly formats. It underpins many of the company’s software-defined platforms, like [ HPE Synergy,](http://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/synergy.html) HPE Storage, Aruba networks and HPE Server management. HPE provides developer support for Grommet through the [HPE Developer Community](https://developer.hpe.com/community) and [GitHub.](https://github.com/grommet/grommet) 

As much as I’ve learned about Grommet, I still have more questions. Like, what’s up with that purple Gremlin creature that keeps showing up on Grommet pages and Grommet stickers? Stay tuned for a future post where I hope to uncover the answer.
