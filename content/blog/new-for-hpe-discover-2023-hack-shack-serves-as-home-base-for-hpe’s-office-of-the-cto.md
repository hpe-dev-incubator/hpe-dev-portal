Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) will be hosting Discover 2023 from June 20-22 at the Venetian Convention and Expo Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. The HPE Developer Community team is excited to be there once again to greet customers and partners in the Hack Shack. There will be some exciting changes this year. Read on to learn more about what will be happening in the Hack Shack!

## What’s new for the Hack Shack?

Since 2017, the HPE Hack Shack has been enjoyed by developers as a place to meet with HPE software engineers and other software subject matter experts, to brainstorm about solutions to issues they may be experiencing back home, and to learn a bit more about what HPE is doing in the software space. It’s also provided an opportunity for attendees to enjoy a little down time, relaxing over a few games and software-focused Hack Shack challenges.

This year, the Hack Shack will serve as the Technology Hub for technologists of all types; be they developers, data scientists, ITOps or DevOps personnel. It will be the home base for the HPE Office of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), where you’ll be able to meet and chat with engineering representatives and subject matter experts (SMEs) who work on the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. Here, you’ll get to have in-depth conversations about the platform that was created to eliminate complexity, delivering a cloud experience for customer workloads wherever their data may be. 

The Hack Shack will complement the CTO Theater, where over a dozen different HPE GreenLake platform sessions will take place covering everything from platform APIs to future innovations, by providing a place where you can continue the conversations and hone in on any specific questions you might have.

## What is the HPE Office of the CTO?

Today’s highly interconnected world requires easier, more secure ways to access and use the data that has become our life force. The HPE Office of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) leads HPE’s hotbed of innovation. Office of the CTO team members are heavily involved in R&D to find and develop new ways to do this. They help create history, pushing the industry forward by redefining what cloud computing means and advancing customers’ and partners’ businesses in ways they could not previously have imagined.

The organization is responsible for the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, bringing the economy, ease of use, and scalability of a cloud experience to where a customer’s data lives. In addition, the group incubates projects around a variety of emerging technologies to bring the company’s most innovative products and services to market. 

As companies strive for a future where they are fully autonomous, HPE GreenLake will help them get there, delivering AI-driven smart services that are:

* Fully automated
* Continuous
* Self-healing
* Self-aware
* Fully distributed
* Auto-compliant
* Self-learning
* Self-securing

The Office of the CTO is driving this transformation through its work on the HPE GreenLake platform and its innovation. The group is home to some of the brightest and best talent that HPE has to offer, and is working to attract even more.

### Prize winning activities and celebration party

As in previous years, the Hack Shack will feature a lot of fun activities. The HPE Developer Community Virtual Treasure Hunt is a fan favorite. This year, 12 winners will be awarded a developer-branded hoodie/sweatshirt! There will be games set up in the yard, like Jenga and corn hole, as well. 

The traditional Hack Shack Celebration party will be held on Wednesday, June 21st. Make sure you stop on by to join in on the fun, food, and games!

### Hack Shack challenges

For those looking for more mind-stimulating activities, there will be 4 Hack Shack challenges this year focused on the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform.  They will center on the HPE GreenLake Aruba Central API, the HPE Data Services Cloud Console API, the HPE Compute Ops Management API and the Private Cloud Enterprise Terraform provider. These are perfect for those who’d like some hands-on experience in working with these APIs. 

### Post-presentation “Meet the experts” sessions

Event attendees are invited to Meet-the-Expert sessions immediately following presentations being held in the CTO Theater. After attending the session in the theater, you’ll have the opportunity to follow the speaker back to the Hack Shack and continue the conversation in a fun and friendly environment.

### Customer-engaging meetups

New for this year, the Hack Shack will host 4 different meetup sessions for customers to meet with the CTO, other HPE executives, and HPE Fellows. These meetups are interactive sessions designed to collect customer feedback. In many of them, you’ll be able to share your experiences, challenges, and expectations related to a particular topic. Take advantage of these opportunities to connect with HPE executives on:

* **HPE GreenLake Private Cloud Enterprise**

  In this meetup, share your thoughts on what services, in addition to the resource capacity, could be offered from a managed private cloud services offering. We’d love to hear what key features, functionalities, and capabilities you’d like to see offered as part of, or in addition to the existing bare-metal, VMs and container offerings. 

* **Unlocking Data Insights: Maximizing Your Cloud's Potential**

  In this meetup, we’d love to hear your thoughts on what the minimum data services a cloud platform should offer. Focus on key features, functionalities, and capabilities that you consider essential in any cloud data service. 

* **Site-as-a-Service**

  Starting with a brief presentation from the Office of the CTO on HPE current and near-term projects, this meetup will focus on Site-as-a-Service, where HPE performs edge management on behalf of an enterprise, as well as work in distributed data and workload management at the edge. After the presentation, we will lead an open discussion on the challenges and requirements of the use and management of distributed edge sites in the enterprise and how HPE can help address them.

* **Simplifying Hybrid Cloud Operations**

  In this meetup, we invite you to share your perspectives and experiences in managing IT operations across a hybrid cloud environment. We’ll delve into various challenges and use cases in monitoring, managing events, and automating tasks using the OpsRamp solution. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to engage with industry peers and have a say in product directions by joining this session.
