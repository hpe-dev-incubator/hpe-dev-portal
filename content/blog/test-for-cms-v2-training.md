The HPE DEV team is excited to present its revamped HPE Developer Community web portal. Featuring a fresh look and feel with easier navigation, it provides the resources you need to design and build software experiences that harness the most value from your data. With a new backend system and new design, it’s easier to use and contribute to. In addition, we’re delighted to be able to share our new Twitter handle with you, @HPE_DEV, a simplification many of you have requested.
