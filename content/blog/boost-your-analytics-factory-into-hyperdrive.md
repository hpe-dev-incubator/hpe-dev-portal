You know that there’s a treasure trove of value hidden in the data streaming all around you. But how do you capture it, analyze it, and extract that golden nugget of information that impacts your applications? More importantly, how do you do this when the data is constantly changing? Critical applications need to be able to make decisions in real-time or risk the possibility of failure.



In today’s data-driven world, being able to distill data into meaningful insights is key. But the deployment of analytics and data science in today’s organizations tends to be spotty and run through uncoordinated efforts. Organizations are looking for a unified experience that spans across environments. In the free, [HPE Ezmeral \\\ Analytics Unleashed](https://hpe.events.cube365.net/hpe/hpeezmeral) virtual event being held on March 17, 2021, experts will show you how you can industrialize your data to accelerate your data-driven transformation.



This 90-minute event, packed with multiple sessions, talks, and demos, will focus on the top challenges many companies face as they attempt to harness the power of their data, and how data scientists are using HPE Ezmeral to overcome these challenges. Experts will demo three real-world Day in the Life examples and discuss best practices in scaling artificial intelligence (AI) to meet the needs of the enterprise.



To start the day, Kirk Borne, globally known data scientist and thought leader on all things data-at-edge, will share his perspective on a few key questions many in the industry are asking. He’ll also offer his thoughts on how the HPE Ezmeral portfolio can help. Afterwards, Kumar Sreekanti, CTO & Head of Software and Robert Christiansen, VP of Strategy, Office of the CTO, will give you an inside scoop on how the HPE Ezmeral portfolio helps ensure data is always accessible, scalable, and secure. Later, you’ll hear from three customers, Ericsson, DXC, and ORock, who will describe how they each are able to unlock the value of their data. Some of the topics they’ll cover include containerizing apps in complex enterprise environments, scaling data intensive workloads with speed and security, and managing legacy transformations.



The Day in the Life Demo Showcase will focus on three scenarios:



•	A Day in the Life of Data, which follows the arc of data as it is intelligently stretched and stitched across the HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric.



•	A Day in the Life of a Data Scientist, where you’ll get to see a demo on how HPE Ezmeral enables a data scientist to self-serve data, spin-up infrastructure, and leverage analytic toolkits.



•	A Day in the Life of an IT Admin, where you’ll be walked through basic infrastructure set up so you can see how HPE Ezmeral simplifies the management of infrastructure for analytics.



By seeing how others have overcome the challenges of harnessing the power of data through analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, you’ll be able to bring back ideas that will work for your organization. So, take advantage of this free event. There’s no registration required. Simply join us for [HPE Ezmeral \\\ Analytics Unleashed](https://hpe.events.cube365.net/hpe/hpeezmeral) on March 17th, 2021 at 8 a.m. PT / 4 p.m. GMT.

We’ll also be sharing details on how HPE is collaborating with technology partners, like Dataiku and Run:AI through the HPE Ezmeral marketplace – a one-stop shop where customers can come to explore, learn, engage, and deploy with technology partners and open source projects. Join the ISV Ecosystem team and our partners to see how you can leverage a wide variety of different validated partner tools to improve the quality and reliability of your end-to-end solutions.
