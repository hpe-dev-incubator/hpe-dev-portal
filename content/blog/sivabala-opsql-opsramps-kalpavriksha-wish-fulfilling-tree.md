# sivabala OpsQL - OpsRamp's Kalpavriksha wish-fulfilling tree



  

In the realm of IT operations, managing and retrieving data efficiently is crucial. OpsRamp, a comprehensive IT operations management platform, offers a robust query language known as OpsQL (OpsRamp Query Language). OpsQL empowers users to perform complex searches within the OpsRamp platform.



What is OpsQL?

OpsQL is a flexible and powerful query language to search objects within the OpsRamp platform. It allows users to retrieve specific data based on various attributes and conditions. OpsQL is essential for IT administrators to quickly access and manipulate data, in order to maintain optimal system performance and resolve issues.



Basic Syntax and Structure

The general syntax for an OpsQL query is straightforward:

```PlainText
 <attribute> <operator> | <coperator> "<value>" [[<operator> [<attribute> | <coperator> "<value>"[)]] ... ]
```

You can combine multiple expressions using logical operators like `AND` and `OR` to refine your search further.
#### Common Operators and Logical OperatorsOpsQL supports a variety of operators to create precise queries:- Equality Operators: `=`, `!=`\- String Operators: `CONTAINS`, `STARTS WITH`, `LIKE`\- Logical Operators: `AND`, `OR`For example, to find all resources with an agent installed and of type "Windows," you would use:

```PlainText
agentInstalled = "true" AND type = "Windows"
```

\#### AttributesAttributes are different types of information available on an object. For instance, a resource might have attributes like `make`, `ipAddress`, and `agentInstalled`, while an alert might have attributes like `priority`, `currentState`, and `createdTime`.#### Practical ExamplesHere are some practical examples of OpsQL queries:- Filter Docker Containers:

```PlainText
type CONTAINS "Docker_Container"
```

\- Filter by Resource Type and Serial Number:

```PlainText
  serialNumber STARTS WITH "abc" AND type = "linux"
```

\- Filter by Agent Installation and Make:

```PlainText
agentInstalled = "true" AND make = "LENOVO"
```

\#### Benefits of Using OpsQL1. Efficiency: OpsQL allows for quick and efficient data retrieval, which is essential for maintaining system performance and resolving issues promptly.2. Flexibility: The ability to combine multiple expressions and use various operators provides flexibility in creating complex queries tailored to specific needs.3. Precision: With OpsQL, users can create highly precise queries to filter and manage data, ensuring that they can access exactly what they need without sifting through irrelevant information.#### ConclusionOpsQL is a powerful tool within the OpsRamp platform that enhances the ability of IT administrators to manage and retrieve data efficiently. Its flexible syntax and robust capabilities make it an indispensable part of IT operations management, enabling users to maintain optimal system performance and quickly resolve issues.For more detailed information and examples, you can refer to the [OpsRamp Documentation](https://docs.opsramp.com/platform-features/feature-guides/query-language-reference/query-language-ref/)[1](https://docs.opsramp.com/platform-features/feature-guides/query-language-reference/query-language-ref/ "Query Language Reference | OpsRamp Documentation").If you have any specific queries or need further assistance with OpsQL, feel free to ask!
