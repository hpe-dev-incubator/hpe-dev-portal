HPE DEV and Design engineers are looking forward to attending two upcoming conferences – [JSConf](https://2019.jsconf.us/)  and [React Rally.](https://www.reactrally.com/) HPE Chief Designer, Chris Carlozzi, as well as UX Designer/Developer, Eric Soderberg, and HPE Senior Open Source Developer, Shimrit Yacobi, will be participating in panel discussions at JSConf. HPE DEV lead, Alex Mejias and members of his software development team will staff the HPE DEV area at React Rally.

## JSConf US 2019

[JSConf US 2019](https://2019.jsconf.us/) is a unique developer conference that invites the JavaScript community to spend three days listening to impactful speaker sessions, communing with industry leaders, and participating in lots of [fun activities.](https://2019.jsconf.us/about/activities/) JSConf US is the only conference where attendees can learn how to push their favorite language beyond the confines of the browser and into robots and video games. 

The JSConf format provides [two different tracks for attendees.](https://2019.jsconf.us/schedule/#first-day-of-talks) JavaScript pioneer, Sitepen, a modern web consultancy specializing in Enterprise JavaScript, is sponsoring one track, and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) is sponsoring the other. While the Sitepen track includes sessions from a curated set of speakers, HPE’s track features a unique format that encourages anyone to speak on a first-come/first-speak basis. These talks, some of the most exciting at JSConf, tend to cover the full range of web development and the world of JavaScript.

[Historically, JSConf](https://jsconf.com/) has been the launch pad for many web innovations. Their call-for-papers process is designed to shine the spotlight on the latest ideas and future leaders of the JavaScript world. This volunteer-run conference focuses on shared social experiences and does its best to make a difference in the community. Some examples include offering scholarships to attend the conference, serving vegetarian food alternatives, and providing childcare services during the conference. JSConf will be held August 12-13 in Carlsbad, CA. 

## React Rally

Another community conference HPE DEV and Design engineers are looking forward to is [React Rally.](https://www.reactrally.com/) This conference focuses on the React ecosystem and topics that are interesting to React developers. Its friendly, welcoming atmosphere, engaging talks from new and established speakers, and opportunities for attendees to chat with industry leaders makes React Rally a popular event among those in the React community.

A unique attribute of this conference is the audience and speaker interaction. There are no Q&A’s after the talks. Instead, audience members are encouraged to discuss issues with speakers during planned downtime sessions; thereby facilitating more effective sharing of perspectives.

With this goal in mind, React Rally features a lot of downtime throughout the day where speakers and the audience can interact informally in a more relaxed atmosphere. This unstructured time is valued just as much as the structured sessions, and it’s referred to as the hallway track. At other conferences, attendees sometimes skip a talk in order to hang out in the hallway and talk to all the interesting people you meet at the conference. Organizers didn’t want React Rally attendees to have to choose between sessions and informal conversations, so they put a lot of emphasis on break times, encouraging this type of discourse.

If you happen to be going to React Rally August 22-23, 2019 in Salt Lake Utah, keep an eye out for HPE DEV members like Alex Mejias. The HPE DEV team is looking forward to being there to engage in conversations with you.
