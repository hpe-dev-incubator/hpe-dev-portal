The [HPE DEV Workshops-on-Demand](/hackshack/workshops) are a great way to get hands-on experience with the newest and most popular technologies. These free workshops are easy to take and really give you a good feel for how to interact with things like containers, data fabric, Kubernetes, etc. We understand that you put in time and effort whenever you take one of our HPE DEV Workshops-on-Demand and we now offer badges in recognition of your achievement.

Now, every time you finish one of our Workshops-on-Demand, you will receive a badge commemorating having completed that specific workshop. You’ll receive the badge in your final, congratulatory email. Share your badge with friends and colleagues on Twitter or LinkedIn directly from the email to show them what new skills you’ve recently acquired.

### More opportunities to collect badges!

But that’s not all! Once you have finished 3 different workshops, you’ll receive an additional badge celebrating your achievement. More badges will be provided once you’ve completed 5, 7, 10, and 15 workshops. Climb the ranks, from **Apprentice** to **Expert** on to **Hero** and **Super Her**o and, ultimately, to **Legend!** Share these on your social media channels as well, competing with friends and colleagues to see who can make it to the highest level!

In addition to any other recognition we grant them, special badges will be awarded to those who create a Jupyter Notebook-based workshop that we can offer to the rest of the HPE Developer Community. Put your thinking caps on to try and collect one of these special badges.

The HPE DEV Community is a great place where we can all enjoy some fun now and again. Try out some of our newest workshops found here on the [HPE DEV Workshops-on-Demand](/hackshack/workshops) page. You can also navigate there from our HPE DEV portal [Skill Up](https://developer.hpe.com/skillup) page. The workshops are great for getting acquainted with these newer technologies and boosting your skill set. And now they’re even more fun!
