DragonHPC was featured again at this year's Supercomputing 2024 conference as part of a special workshop on High Performance Python for Science at Scale. DragonHPC's presentation focused on telemetry and visualization for complex HPC and AI workflows. The workshop featured a range of different Python efforts for scientific computing at HPE, Argonne National Lab, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and the University of Delaware.

Here is a link to this year's conference workshop presentation:

DragonHPC is a composable and highly versatile distributed runtime for HPC & AI workflows. The DragonHPC distributed runtime is Python native but also extensible to other common programming languages. DragonHPC can help orchestrate distributed processes effectively, access distributed data efficiently, and can be used on heterogeneous hardware.

DragonHPC would be of benefit and high interest for HPC & AI software developers, architects, researchers, and data scientists.
