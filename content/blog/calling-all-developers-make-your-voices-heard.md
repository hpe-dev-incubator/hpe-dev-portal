# HPE DEV partners with SlashData for its State of the Developer Nation 2021 survey

As technologists, your world is always changing. And you want to stay on top of what’s next. To understand these trends and what is important to engineers today, [SlashData](http://slashdata.co/) runs its developer survey twice yearly. The survey is expected to reach more than 36,000 developers across 159 countries to better understand who they are, what tools they use, and what they need.

HPE Dev will once again be joining forces with SlashData as a media partner for the June 2021 developer survey. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), a technology  and everything-as-a-service company, understands the importance of developers and how working with them is key to improving the way people live and work. We know that data drives business decisions, and so we encourage all our HPE DEV community members to take this survey and make their voices heard. 

SlashData's global, independent research is available in multiple languages and dives deeply into 12 important areas such as web, cloud, IoT, games, ML/AI, and data science. While this in-depth survey may take 20 minutes of your time, your effort will will be rewarded by helping to drive change that meets your future needs.

The survey covers programming languages and tools, skill sets, and the resources developers use. It also focuses on key technology areas, including cloud, AI, machine learning, and game development. SlashData understands your time is important and offers incentives to encourage participation, including [numerous opportunities to win prizes](https://www.developereconomics.net/prizes).

Using the data acquired through this research, SlashData produces “State of the Developer Nation” reports twice a year. You can find these free reports [here](https://www.slashdata.co/free-resources?section=subscribe). The data derived from these reports makes its way back to technology companies to address the current needs of developers around the world. You can use these reports yourself to understand how the industry continues to evolve and make the right choices for your business.

Don’t wait! This wave of the survey is only available until August 4, 2021. Although it’s promoted by several other media partners, we would grateful if you could use [our link](https://www.developereconomics.net/?member_id=hpe) to participate in the survey because it will provide us with specific data on how we can best address your needs. Feel free to forward this link to customers, partners, colleagues and friends who might also be interested in participating.
