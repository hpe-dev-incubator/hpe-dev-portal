# HPE DEV to attend KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2019 in May


Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is excited to be attending [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2019](http://https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2019/) in Barcelona, Spain, May 20-23. Over 6,000 talented individuals in the industry are expected to gather, making it a great place to network with industry professionals and learn from top cloud native experts. 
At the HPE Booth (G3), our team of subject matter experts will focus on 3 main topics that will help DevOps administrators and developers take advantage of Kubernetes clusters. These include:

* Containers-as-a-service and Kubernetes Clusters-as-a-service
* Persistent Storage for Kubernetes
* The HPE DEV community

Through [HPE OneSphere](http://https://www.hpe.com/us/en/solutions/cloud/onesphere.html) and our Persistent Storage for Kubernetes, HPE provides DevOps administrators with an automated, easy to manage Kubernetes clusters as a Service, deployable across hybrid cloud architectures (public and private) in a coherent and cost-controlled way. We offer both centrally managed and consumer deployed and managed clusters on public cloud (AWS), on-prem (VMware ESX) and on bare metal, to enable agile, DevOps environments.

If you are a DevOps Admin concerned with providing Kubernetes Clusters and Containers to the masses, or a developer who would like to understand the benefits of joining the HPE DEV community, please visit us at the HPE Booth (G3) in the Sponsor Showcase. When you stop by our booth, sign up for the HPE DEV newsletter and be entered for a chance to win a prize!
