We’re all familiar with model serving — deploying LLMs like GPT, LLaMA, or Mistral behind APIs. But what if you could serve not just a model — but a **complete AI agent with memory, tools, goals, and personality**?

This is the essence of Agentic AI Serving using the AGNO Framework — a next-gen architecture where agents are hosted, monitored, and interacted with like full applications.

#### This guide covers:

* What Agentic AI Serving is
* How to serve agents via the AGNO Playground
* Hosting single or multi-agent systems
* Capturing session data for compliance and observability

## What is Agentic AI serving?

### In traditional GenAI:

LLMs are stateless tools. You orchestrate logic around them.

### In Agentic AI:

The agent contains the logic — tools, reasoning, goals, and memory — and can be served as an interactive, stateful application.

### Serving means:

* Hosting the agent as an interactive app
* Enabling real-time communication and control
* Monitoring its behavior, tools, and outputs
* Running agents like microservices — locally or in the cloud

### AGNO enables:

* Agent-as-a-Service deployment
* Browser-based chat interface
* Support for OpenAI, Claude, Ollama, DeepSeek, and more
* Full session monitoring and conversation logging

## Getting practical: serving your first Agent

### 1. Set up AGNO Playground

Ensure you're using an AGNO-compatible environment such as autogen_py_3_11_11, and that Ollama or OpenAI is accessible.

### 2. Sample playground.py Script

```
import os
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.ollama import Ollama
from agno.playground import Playground, serve_playground_app

# Set environment variables
os.environ\['AGNO_API_KEY'] = 'ag-\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\**-U'
os.environ\['AGNO_MONITOR'] = 'true'  # Enable session tracking
```

### Define a news reporter agent

```
agent = Agent(

model=Ollama(id="llama3.2", provider="Ollama"),

description="You are an enthusiastic news reporter with a flair for storytelling!",

markdown=True

)
```

### (Optional) Test agent locally before serving

```
agent.print_response("Tell me about a breaking news story from New York.", stream=True)
```

#### Create playground app

```
app = Playground(agents=agent).get_app()
```

\### Launch local playground

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
serve_playground_app("playground:app", reload=True)
```

Access Your Hosted Agent

```
#After running:
python playground.py

https://app.agno.com/playground/chat?endpoint=localhost:7777&agent=<your-agent-id>
```

You now have a fully interactive Agentic AI service — complete with memory, tools, and autonomy — accessible via browser.

### Bonus: Team Agent serving

Want to host multiple agents with different skills, roles, or tools?

```
 app = Playground(agents=team.members).get_app() 
```

**Each agent maintains:**

* Its own LLM backend (OpenAI, Ollama, Claude, etc.)
* Independent tools and reasoning logic
* Unique personality or domain focus
* Access to shared memory or state if configured

Perfect for multi-agent collaboration, delegation, or workflows.

### Session Logging & Monitoring

#### AGNO includes built-in monitoring:

```
os.environ\['AGNO_MONITOR'] = 'true' 
```

This activates:

* Session logs
* Tool call traces
* Execution monitoring
* Replay/debug capabilities

Essential for enterprise use cases requiring reproducibility, auditing, or compliance.

## Pro tips

You can deploy AGNO agents:

* Locally, using models from Ollama
* Remotely, using cloud LLM APIs
* In production, with full-stack hosting
* As teams, where each agent plays a defined role

## Final thoughts

Agentic AI Serving is the bridge between prompt engineering and software deployment. You’re not just sending prompts — you’re hosting intelligent, tool-using entities with goals and context.

This is where GenAI becomes AI Systems — and agents become deployable, trackable, and interactive applications.
