As stated in last year’s KubeCon keynote; “our lives have gone remote – our challenges have gone global.” The [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF) will address this challenge through its flagship conference, [KubeCon | CloudNativeCon EU](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) delivered via a virtual platform May 4-7, 2021. And Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) will once again be there, excited for the opportunity to show what it offers in the areas of containers and Kubernetes (k8s)!

New this year, HPE Principal Software Engineer Daniel Feldman, will speak on how to securely bridge cloud-native and traditional workloads with SPIRE. Daniel is a major contributor to the SPIRE project, an open source zero trust security layer for cloud services. With a strong background in security, Daniel will cover the challenges organizations face when going cloud native, and how the CNCF’s SPIRE project provides the solution to help establish secure service identities across an organization. Make sure you check out his lightening talk on Tuesday, May 4th at 15:00 CEST. Find it on [the schedule here](https://kccnceu2021.sched.com/event/igUc). 

## Discover what’s new in our virtual Hack Shack!

HPE’s presence at the event will again include the [HPE Developer Community](https://developer.hpe.com/) Hack Shack.[](https://developer.hpe.com/) In the [HPE DEV Hack Shack,](/hackshack/) developers, designers, and data scientists have the opportunity to connect with HPE subject matter experts and collaborate with them to accelerate innovation using open source and HPE technologies. It’s a unique place designed to give virtual events a more personal touch and extend the experience beyond the event. Here, you’ll find lots of opportunities to learn and have fun! Make sure you check out the HPE DEV Treasure hunt for an opportunity to win HPE DEV swag!

To get a complete picture of what’s happening in the virtual Hack Shack, take a [tour now](https://vimeo.com/444872340). Here’s a snapshot of what you will find:

* [WORKSHOPS-ON-DEMAND:](/hackshack/workshops)  Access over a dozen free, on-demand hands-on training courses that include ***Building a dynamic Machine Learning pipeline with KubeDirector*** and ***Using Kubernetes CSI with HPE Ezmeral Container Platform***. Using a Jupyter Notebook environment, you’ll have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience across different technologies, like KubeDirector and the HPE Ezmeral Container Platform REST API. You’ll also find numerous replays of talks we’ve given at different events and a complete selection of material on the HPE Ezmeral Platform, an enterprise-grade platform used to deploy Kubernetes at scale for a wide range of use cases on bare metal or VMs.


* [TREASURE HUNT:](/hackshack/arcade) New this year, our scavenger-hunt style challenge offers an opportunity for you to check out all the resources that are available on the HPE Developer Community website and the Hack Shack. Be one of the first people to answer all the questions correctly and win an HPE DEV hat!


* [REPLAYS:](/hackshack/replays) Augmenting our Workshops-on-Demand, we’ve posted replays of many of the technical workshops we’ve offered live in the past. View them to learn more about the [HPE Ezmeral Container Platform](/hackshack/replays/1), [SPIFFE and SPIRE authentication](/hackshack/replays/5), and the [HPE Container Storage Interface for Kubernetes](/hackshack/replays/2).

* [ARCADE:](/hackshack/arcade)  In our arcade, you’ll find Hack Shack Attack! Give our popular retro-style video game a try and compete with your friends for the highest score. Here, you can also download stickers, Zoom backgrounds, and cool artwork to use on your social channels.


* [COMMUNITY:](/hackshack/community)  We invite you to join and contribute your expertise on our blog or deliver an on-demand workshop. Connect with others in the community via the [HPE Ezmeral Software Forum](https://community.hpe.com/t5/HPE-Ezmeral-Software-platform/bd-p/ezmeral-software-platform#.YGzDjuhKg2w), or our [Slack ](https://slack.hpedev.io/)and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HPE_DevCom) channels to start conversations and get answers to questions. Sign-up for our [HPE DEV Newsletter](https://developer.hpe.com/newsletter-signup) to stay up-to-date on the newest blog posts and tutorials. 


* [SKILL UP:](https://developer.hpe.com/skillup) There are even more opportunities to get together and learn when you’re part of the HPE DEV Community. From the Hack Shack, hop on over to the HPE DEV portal where you’ll find our monthly Munch & Learn gatherings. These free, one-hour meetups are designed to provide developers and data scientists the opportunity to meet and engage with experts in popular HPE and open source technologies.

As always, the[ HPE DEV community](https://developer.hpe.com/community) is excited to have an opportunity to connect with other technologists at an event such as this. If you’re planning on attending, make sure you stop on by and say “Hi” in the Hack Shack by dropping us a note in our [Slack Channel](https://slack.hpedev.io/).
