Ever since OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, there’s been no question that we have entered into the Age of AI. The possibilities Generative AI affords to accelerating innovation is too compelling to ignore. But ever since then, enterprises have struggled with how to implement AI solutions. Their expense and complexity have proven to be significant barriers to entry.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and NVIDIA took a bold step forward at HPE Discover 2024, making several important announcements that aim to enable enterprise AI adoption. With purpose-built AI solutions delivered through [HPE GreenLake cloud](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/greenlake.html) that combine the technical prowess of these two companies, they will introduce to the market a simplicity of experience that just may jump start mass corporate AI adoption. 

HPE GreenLake delivers a portfolio of cloud services and as-a-service solutions across locations, from the edge to the data center and to the cloud, with simple, agile, and secure hybrid multicloud management. It serves as the base for these solutions. Additional announcements related to the platform focused on offering customers new options for virtualization and providing cloud-type operations for highly regulated environments. 

## Leading the enterprise charge in AI

### Solving for humanity with humanity

Focusing an important corporate event on artificial intelligence can be risky. Fear of the unknown is bound to be in the hearts and minds of attendees. But, as so many pointed out during the event, we have already entered the Age of AI. Isn’t it better that we now take the lead and focus on using AI for the betterment of humanity, setting appropriate guardrails in place, and helping drive its adoption in a positive way?

This was the bold leadership stance taken by the two leaders as HPE CEO Antoino Neri and NVIDEO founder and CEO Jensen Huang took to the stage in the Sphere at Las Vegas to open Discover 2024. Delivering the first [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p28lHtjWn5k) ever in this amazing venue, Antonio spoke of the hope and limitless possibilities AI could bring for renewable energy, medical breakthroughs, and revolutionized agriculture. 

Accompanied by video emphasizing these points, Antonio broke the barrier and started the hard conversation. Imbuing hope, he did not shy away from mentioning the risks involved and was quick to point out how HPE has been preparing for AI for a very long time, developing the technology and guardrails to help make AI a positive force for our planet.

### Accelerating enterprise GenAI adoption

During the keynote, Antonio and Jensen jointly announced the launch of NVIDIA AI Computing by HPE, a comprehensive portfolio of co-developed AI solutions designed to accelerate the adoption of generative AI in enterprises.
