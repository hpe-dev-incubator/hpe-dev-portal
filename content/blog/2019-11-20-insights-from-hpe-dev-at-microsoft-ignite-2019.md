The light shone brightly on HPE DEV at Microsoft Ignite 2019, as we shared knowledge, collaborated, and connected with developers. Our objectives at this show were straightforward – show how to build the best possible experiences with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) solutions. We did that by:

1. Demonstrating how the HPE development toolset/frameworks easily build out end-to-end applications 
2. Exhibiting real-world use cases with practical suggestions and ideas 
3. Promoting the HPE DEV Community and showcasing how we’re encouraging developer collaboration
4. Spotlighting key HPE offerings around IoT and edge computing, Microsoft Azure and Azure Stack 

HPE DEV supported the HPE tagline __Fear no Cloud__ by demonstrating how attendees could consume Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services at edge and by demystifying DevOps for use with Azure Stack as part of a hybrid IT infrastructure.

A live demo showing Face Detection with Azure Cognitive Services was one of the main attractions at the event. The demo offered a great opportunity for attendees to visualize an application architecture built with lightweight containers running in a Kubernetes cluster on a ruggedized Edgeline300 Server receiving a live feed from a simple, everyday camera. Each attendee was able to interact with the application and find out more about how edge processing works in real world use cases combining artificial intelligence (AI) with the best HPE solutions for edge computing.

The HPE DEV demonstration of DevOps workflows with an HPE Proliant for Microsoft Azure Stack Hub satisfied developer curiosity regarding how hybrid IT can support and extend an application’s capability from Edge to Cloud with a __Fear No Cloud__ mindset.

As HPE DEV has done in previous events, attendees had the opportunity to play the [Hack Shack Attack](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/hpe-hack-shack-attack) game, an open source 8-bit arcade game. To add to the fun, as part of a raffle encouraging folks to sign up for the HPE DEV newsletter, we offered a prize each day to one lucky winner.

*And the winner is…*

There were many announcements during Microsoft Ignite, but the two most significant to HPE were:

__Azure Arc:__ Microsoft was among the first of the big cloud vendors to bet big on hybrid deployments. With Azure Arc, the company is taking this a step further. It will let enterprises use Azure to manage their resources across clouds -- including those of competitors, such as AWS and Google Cloud. 

HPE played a key role in the announcement, with the HPE Superdome Flex featured prominently on the announcement stage. HPE will participate in the preview of the product and, although it’s not yet publically available, customers can sign up for this now.

__Azure Stack Portfolio:__
Microsoft also launched a full portfolio of hybrid solutions, spanning from the edge to Azure Stack Hub (previously referred to as Azure Stack).

The HPE DEV area was the talk of town within the HPE booth. It had a stronger than ever presence given the number of developers and Microsoft MVP’s in attendance who wanted to know more about real world use case examples and to see sample code. Many wanted to directly signup as part of the HPE DEV Community and keep plugged into HPE DEV collaborations.

As the tradeshow floor activities wound down, Microsoft hosted an event at Universal Studios. Like everyone else, HPE DEV joined in the fun.
