# Infrastructure as code with HPE OneView and Ansible by Red Hat

One of the ways DevOps practitioners achieve agility is by provisioning the infrastructure at the same time as the application or service. They use automation to provision infrastructure using the same scripts to deploy exact copies of development, test, and production environments. These techniques work well in cloud and virtualized environments, but often hit a wall when applied to physical infrastructure.
[HPE OneView](https://hpe.com/info/oneview) and [Ansible by Red Hat](https://www.ansible.com/) enable physical infrastructure as code, bringing cloud like agility to the private data center.

The [whitepaper](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-ansible-samples/blob/master/infrastructure-as-code/infrastructure-as-code.md) *Infrastructure as code with HPE OneView and Ansible by Red Hat* and accompanying [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-ansible-samples/tree/master/infrastructure-as-code) guides customers and partners in automating the provisioning of physical infrastructure. These playbooks can be checked into source control allowing you to treat infrastructure as code.

Benefits of this infrastructure as code approach include, complete data center automation, consistent reproducibility, versioning, and rollback.
