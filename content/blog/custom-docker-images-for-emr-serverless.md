EMR serverless provides a viable option to spin spark applications and use resources optimally for the duration of the application.  It provides us with easy options to quickly set up a spark environment for processing data. It is often the case that one needs to build custom images in EMR serverless primarily due to the fact that the application is using specialized libraries that don’t come with EMR serverless base image.  A well-known scenario we have encountered was the need for a few module and jar dependencies. eg., installation of a python library pycopg2, boto3, pyyaml, delta-core, delta-storage.

While there exists an option to have them installed at a run time ie., when the image is running on a container and a custom script can be used to install,  it is desirable as it is in the case of the production environment to have these pre-installed to avoid any last mile issues in terms of connectivity to download, etc., In this article, we walk through a very useful utility for EMR serverless ie., building custom images with custom libraries for EMR serverless application.

Our first use case is the utilization of Delta Lake over S3. Delta lake (<https://delta.io>) is an open-source storage framework that enables building a lake house architecture. One of the important features supported by delta lake is the checkpoint management for batch/streaming jobs that uses AWS S3 as a data lake. The most common approach to use Delta lake is via command line argument to run spark-submit command something like *"sparkSubmitParameters": "--packages io. delta:delta-core_2.12:1.2.1"*. This dynamically pulls the delta lake (via maven project) when the spark jobs run (ref. <https://docs.delta.io/latest/quick-start.html#pyspark-shell> ). The other approach is to use **pip install delta-spark==2.2.0** when python is used**.** However, both these approaches in production might not be possible as they require an active internet connection, necessarily permissions on the production machine to download/install a library at run time in the EMR serverless application.

Our second use case is the installation of all custom libraries (in the form of jars etc.,) used by the code. In a usual docker setting it is feasible to do it either at run time or using python-pip to install the required packages. Again due to restricted settings on the production environment (download permissions, internet connectivity requirements), it is advisable that we have a custom image built for our required software and its version and use that image as an EMR Serverless docker image. 

In this article, we provide step by step walkthrough of how we build custom images, use the ECR to register our docker image, and use the docker image in the EMR Serverless.

*Step 1:*  Understanding the pre-requisites

*Step 2:*  Identify the base EMR Serverless Docker Image, packages/jars that need to be installed/downloaded, and prepare the custom docker Image.

*Step 3:*  Push the Docker Image to the ECR

*Step 4:* Create the EMR Serverless applications via

(a) Command using AWS CLI

(b) through settings in the UI when creating or updating the EMR serverless application.

## Step 1: Prerequisites to build a custom docker image for EMRServerless application:

* The latest version of the docker client
* The latest version of AWS CLI
* Verify the access to dependent repository from where resources (modules, code etc) might be downloaded.   

## **Step 2: Sample Docker file used to create custom EMRServerless image**

```
*\# Refer AWS EMR documentation for the release version tag*\
*FROM public.ecr.aws/emr-serverless/spark/emr-6.9.0:20221108*

*USER root*

*\# python packages*\
*RUN pip3 install boto3*\
*RUN pip3 install psycopg2-binary*\
*RUN pip3 install PyYAML*

*\# Dependent JAR files*\
*RUN curl -O <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/delta/delta-core_2.12/2.2.0/delta-core_2.12-2.2.0.jar>*\
*RUN curl -O <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/delta/delta-storage/2.2.0/delta-storage-2.2.0.jar>*

*\# The base emr-image sets WORKDIR to /home/hadoop, hence the JAR files will be downloaded under /home/hadoop.*\
*\# Then these jars will be copied to /usr/lib/spark/jars which was set as SPARK_HOME by EMR base image.*\
*RUN cp /home/hadoop/delta-core_2.12-2.2.0.jar /usr/lib/spark/jars/*\
*RUN cp /home/hadoop/delta-storage-2.2.0.jar /usr/lib/spark/jars/*

*\# EMRS will run the image as hadoop*\
*USER hadoop:hadoop*
```

## **Step 3: Pushing the docker image to the AWS ECR:**

Command to authenticate Docker to an AWS ECR public registry assuming region as us-east-1. As EMRServerless base docker image is present in ECR public registry, run below command before building your customized docker file.

```
***aws ecr-public get-login-password --region us-east-1 --profile <profile_name_in_your_aws_credentials_file> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin public.ecr.aws***
```

Command to build docker image:

```
***docker build -t local_docker_image_name:tag -f <docker_file_name> .***
```

Command to tag locally built docker image in order to push to AWS ECR private registry:

```
**docker tag local_docker_image_name:tag *[aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com](http://aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com)\*\****[/docker_image_name:](http://718515174980.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/emr-serverless-ci-examples:emr-serverless-6.9.0-V1)tag\*\*
```

Command to authenticate Docker to an AWS ECR private registry assuming region as us-east-1. Run below command before pushing the docker image to AWS ECR private registry.

```
***aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 --profile <profile_name_in_your_aws_credentials_file> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin [aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com](http://aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com)***
```

        **Note:**

        1. When --profile option is not provided, then credentials will be picked from profile name <default> in the \~/.aws/credentials file. If you are using access credentials for different user, then include the profile section in \~/.aws/credentials files.

        2.  Example content of ~/.aws/credentials file:          

```
\[default]\
aws_access_key_id        = \
aws_secret_access_key    = 

\[testprofile]\
aws_access_key_id=\
aws_secret_access_key=
```

Command to push docker image to AWS ECR private registry:

       **docker push *[aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com](http://aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com)\*\****[/docker_image_name:](http://718515174980.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/emr-serverless-ci-examples:emr-serverless-6.9.0-V1)tag\*\*

## **Step 4:  EMR Serverless using the custom Docker Image Created.**

There are two approaches for EMR Serverless to use the custom Image created

(a) via AWS CLA

(b) via EMR serverless application settings in AWS management console

### **4a) Via AWS CLI command to create simple EMRServerless application using custom docker image:**

AWS CLI reference for EMRServerless application management: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/emr-serverless/index.html>

```
aws --region <region>  emr-serverless create-application \
    --release-label emr-6.9.0 \
    --type "SPARK" \
    --name emr-application-1 \
    **\--image-configuration '{ "imageUri": "<your AWS account ID>.dkr.ecr.<region>.[amazonaws.com/<ecr_registry_name:](http://amazonaws.com/emr-serverless-ci-examples:emr-serverless-ci-ml)image_name>" }'**
```

**Note:** Image URI can be copied from AWS ECR registry.

### **4b) Via EMR Serverless Settings in the EMR Management console**

##### **EMRServerless Custom Image Settings section in AWS EMR Serverless management console:**

##### Browse and select custom EMRServerless image from AWS ECR private registry in the same region:
