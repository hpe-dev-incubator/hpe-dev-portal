A container registry serves as a centralized system for storing and managing container images. In todayâ€™s fast-paced containerized application development landscape, speed, security and control over container workflows using a robust container registry are critical. While both cloud-based container registries, such as Google Container Registry (*GCR*), Azure Container Registry (*ACR*), and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (*ECR*), and third-party services like *DockerHub*, *GitHub* / *GitLab* Container Registry, and *JFrog* Container Registry, offer convenience, organizations often face challenges with latency, external dependencies, and security compliance constraints. 

This blog post describes the process of deploying *Harbor* and setting it up as a local container registry within *HPE Private Cloud AI*. By using *Harbor* as a local container registry, organizations gain faster image access, reduced dependence on external networks, improved security, and a tailored registry environment that aligns with internal compliance and governance needs.

## HPE Private Cloud AI

[HPE Private Cloud AI (HPE PCAI)](https://developer.hpe.com/platform/hpe-private-cloud-ai/home/) offers a comprehensive, turnkey AI solution designed to address key enterprise challenges, from selecting the appropriate large language models (LLMs) to efficiently hosting and deploying them. Beyond these core functions, HPE PCAI empowers organizations to take full control of their AI adoption journey by offering a curated set of pre-integrated *NVIDIA NIM* LLMs, along with a powerful suite of AI tools and frameworks for *Data Engineering*, *Analytics*, and *Data Science*. 

The *Import Framework* in HPE PCAI further enhances flexibility by enabling organizations to integrate their own applications or third-party solutions alongside pre-installed components, accommodating a wide range of enterprise-specific use cases.

This blog post guides you through the step-by-step process of deploying the open-source *Harbor* into HPE PCAI using the *Import Framework*. Once deployed and configured, *Harbor* can serve as a local container registry within HPE PCAI. With key features such as policy management, role-based access control (RBAC), security scanning, and image signing, *Harbor* strengthens container lifecycle security and governance. 

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure that [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), version *28.1.1* or later, is installed, including the default *docker* CLI, which will be used for building and pushing images.

The following sections show application deployment details using the *kubectl* CLI and *kubeconfig* to access the HPE PCAI Kubernetes (K8s) cluster. However, direct cluster access via *kubectl* is generally not required.

## Harbor

*Harbor* is an open-source container registry designed for cloud-native environments like K8s. It securely stores and manages container images with policies and RBAC, ensures images are scanned and free from vulnerabilities, and signs images as trusted.  

The following sections describe in detail how to deploy *Harbor* into HPE PCAI using the *Import Framework*. You will learn how to create a private project, create users and assign them with specific role permissions, and push images using *Harbor* credentials. Used as a local image registry within HPE PCAI, *Harbor* helps ensure your container images remain secure and well governed. 

### Harbor deployment via HPE PCAI *Import Framework*

Based on the latest Helm charts from the official [*Harbor* site](https://helm.goharbor.io/harbor-1.17.0.tgz), the following YAML manifest files have been added under *templates/ezua/* directory:

* *virtualService.yaml*: Defines an Istio *VirtualService* to configure routing rules for incoming requests.
* *kyverno-cluster-policy*: A Kyverno *ClusterPolicy* that automatically adds required labels to the deployment.

Additionally, the default *values.yaml* file has been modified with the following updates:

* introduced an *ezua* section to configure the *Istio Gateway* and expose the endpoint: 

```bash
      ezua:

        virtualService:
          endpoint: "harbor.${DOMAIN_NAME}"
          istioGateway: "istio-system/ezaf-gateway"
```

* expanded *Harbor* registry storage from the default *5G* to *500G*:

```bash
      persistence.persistentVolumeClaim.registry.size = 500G
```

These updates are implemented in the revised *Harbor* Helm charts, available in the *GitHub* repository [*pcai-helm-examples*](https://github.com/GuopingJia/pcai-helm-examples/tree/main/harbor). With these customizations, *Harbor* can be easily deployed into HPE PCAI using the *Import Framework*:

![](/img/import-harbor.png)

### Harbor UI access via its endpoint

After *Harbor* is deployed via the HPE PCAI *Import Framework*, an **Imported** *Harbor* tile appears under *Tools & Frameworks* on the *Data Science* tab. A service endpoint, e.g., *https://harbor.ingress.pcai0104.ld7.hpecolo.net*, is automatically configured and exposed, providing access to *Harbor*. 
 
![](/img/harbor-deployment.png)

Click the *Open* button, or paste the endpoint URL into your browser, to launch the *Harbor* login page:

![](/img/harbor-login.png)

From there, you can log into *Harbor* projects page using the default *admin* user credentials:

![](/img/harbor-ui.png)

### Harbor project and user creation

*Harbor* manages container images through projects, each of which hosts the image repositories for your application. Before pushing images to *Harbor*, a project must first be created. A default public project named *library* is pre-created, but new projects can be created by clicking *+ NEW PROJECT*:

![](/img/create-project.png)

To enhance security, it's recommended to create *private* projects in *Harbor* to prevent unauthorized images pulls. In this blog post, a private project named *demo* is created with an unlimited quota (**-1**). For production environments, applying a defined quota, e.g., *200G*, can help manage registry storage capacity more effectively.

After creating the project, users can be created and assigned to projects using role-based access control (RBAC). In this blog post, two sample users, *pcai-developer*, & *pcai-admin*, are created: 

![](/img/two-users-harbor.png)

These users, along with the default *admin* user, are added to the project *demo* with distinct roles:
* *pcai-developer* has the **Developer** role (with read/write access to project)
* *pcai-admin* is assigned the **Maintainer** role, with extended privileges including image scanning, replication job visibility and image deletion 

![](/img/project-member.png)

For a detailed breakdown of each role's capabilities, refer to the official [Harbor Managing Users page](https://goharbor.io/docs/2.13.0/administration/managing-users/). As a best practice, production deployments should enforce role separation to maintain security and operational clarity in *Harbor*. 

### Pushing images to Harbor registry

With the project and users set up, you're ready to push the container images to *Harbor* by following these steps:

* *Log in to Harbor registry*

Use the Docker client to authenticate with the *Harbor* registry using the *pcai-admin* user credentials by running the following command :

```shell
$ docker login harbor.ingress.pcai0104.ld7.hpecolo.net
Username: pcai-admin
Password:

WARNING! Your credentials are stored unencrypted in '/home/guoping/.docker/config.json'.
Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
https://docs.docker.com/go/credential-store/

Login Succeeded
```

If you get any certificate error when logging in from a Linux client, update the file */etc/docker/daemon.json* by adding the following entry, replacing the *Harbor* registry URL with your own: 

```shell
{
  "insecure-registries" : [" harbor.ingress.pcai0104.ld7.hpecolo.net "]
}
```

After making this change, reload the daemon and restart the Docker service:

```shell
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl restart docker
```

* *Tag an existing image*

Rather than building a Docker image from a Dockerfile, pull the sample CFE Nginx image, *'pcaidemo/cfe-nginx'*, from *DockerHub* and tag it with the *Harbor* registry URL and project name: 

```shell
$ docker images
REPOSITORY           TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
pcaidemo/cfe-nginx   v0.1.0    1e5f3c5b981a   2 months ago   192MB

$ docker tag pcaidemo/cfe-nginx:v0.1.0 harbor.ingress.pcai0104.ld7.hpecolo.net/demo/cfe-nginx:v0.1.0

$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                               TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
pcaidemo/cfe-nginx                                       v0.1.0    1e5f3c5b981a   2 months ago   192MB
harbor.ingress.pcai0104.ld7.hpecolo.net/demo/cfe-nginx   v0.1.0    1e5f3c5b981a   2 months ago   192MB
```

* *Push the image to Harbor registry*

Push the image to the *Harbor* registry by running the following command:

```shell
$ docker push harbor.ingress.pcai0104.ld7.hpecolo.net/demo/cfe-nginx:v0.1.0
The push refers to repository [harbor.ingress.pcai0104.ld7.hpecolo.net/demo/cfe-nginx]
7e893c1b6ee8: Pushed
463308bed0c9: Pushed

```

* *Verify the image from Harbor registry* 

From the *Harbor* UI, the image *cfe-nginx* appears under *Repositories* tab of the *demo* project:

![](/img/demo-project.png)

From  the Docker client, log in to the *Harbor* registry as the *pcai-developer* user, then pull the image *cfe-nginx* from the registry. The image should download successfully, confirming that the user has appropriate access and the *Harbor* registry is functioning as expected.

```shell
$ docker login harbor.ingress.pcai0104.ld7.hpecolo.net
Username: pcai-developer
Password:

## Application deployment using Harbor registry

With the container images pushed to the *Harbor* registry, the next step is to deploy the application to HPE PCAI using the same *Import Framework*. It will demonstrate how to pull images from *Harbor*. 

The Helm charts of the sample *CFE Nginx* application are available from *GitHub* repository [pcai-helm-examples](https://github.com/GuopingJia/pcai-helm-examples/tree/main/nginx-chart). Alongside the required *virtualService* and Kyverno *ClusterPolicy* YAML files, the *values.yaml* file includes the *imageCredentials* section that specifies the *Harbor* access credentials for the *pcai-developer* user. It also references the *imagePullSecrets* field that uses the Secret resource *harbor*, which is created during deployment, to securely pull container images from the *Harbor* registry.

```shell
image:
  repository: harbor.ingress.pcai0104.ld7.hpecolo.net/demo/cfe-nginx
  pullPolicy: Always
  # Overrides the image tag whose default is the chart appVersion.
  tag: "v0.1.0"

imagePullSecrets: 
  - name: harbor

imageCredentials:
  registry: harbor.ingress.pcai0104.ld7.hpecolo.net
  username: pcai-developer
  password: PCAIDev12345
  email: glcs.cfe@hpe.com
```

Using the provided sample Helm charts, the *CFE Nginx* application can be easily deployed to HPE PCAI via the *Import Framework*. After deployment, an **Imported** *Nginx* tile appears under *Tools & Framework*, along with its configured service endpoint: 

![](/img/nginx-deployment.png)

Clicking the *Open* button launches the *CFE Nginx* main page:

![](/img/nginx-ui.png)

The *CFE Nginx* application is deployed to the namespace *'nginx'* in the K8s cluster. If you have access to the cluster, you can verify the deployment by running the following command:

```shell
# kubectl get all -n nginx
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/nginx-chart-546476cd99-2nqzz   1/1     Running   0          6s

NAME                  TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/nginx-chart   ClusterIP   10.99.78.114   <none>        80/TCP    6s

NAME                          READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/nginx-chart   1/1     1            1           6s

NAME                                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/nginx-chart-546476cd99   1         1         1       6s
```

Within the *'nginx'* namespace , a Secret named *'harbor'*, of type *dockerconfigjson*, is created. This secret is used to authenticate and pull images from the *Harbor* registry during the deployment of the *CFE Nginx* application:

```shell
# kubectl get secret harbor -n nginx
NAME     TYPE                             DATA   AGE
harbor   kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson   1      3m41s
```
Type the following command to observe the *cfe-nginx* image, tagged *v0.1.0*, being pulled from the *demo* private project in *Harbor* registry:

```shell
[root@ez-master01 ~]# k describe pod/nginx-chart-546476cd99-2nqzz -n nginx

## Conclusion

In this blog post, I explored how to deploy *Harbor* to HPE Private Cloud AI and configure it as a local container registry. By setting up a private *Harbor* project and assigning user roles, organizations can securely manage, push and pull container images tailored to their application needs. 

More than just a container registry, *Harbor* strengthens security with built-in vulnerability scanning, image signing, and content trust features, ensuring only verified, compliant images are used across deployments. With *Harbor* integrated into HPE PCAI, organizations can confidently host container images internally, eliminating the need for external registries. The local container registry offers greater control over image provenance and aligns more effectively with organization security policies and regulatory requirements.
