Mark your calendars for November 17-20, 2020! [KubeCon | CloudNativeCon, North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/) is coming, the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s (CNCF)](http://cncf.io/) flagship event, and you won’t want to miss it! Because of its increased involvement with CNCF and commitment to open source technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is excited to upgrade its sponsorship to the Diamond level. This allows us to more deeply connect with technologists worldwide, offering them easy access to experts, technology, and tools to accelerate digital transformation.

Solutions for security, data-centric workloads, and workflow challenges will be front and center, with lots of opportunities to engage in direct conversations with HPE subject matter experts. Make sure you attend the HPE speaker sessions and demos, and take advantage of the hands-on technical workshops in the HPE Developer Community Hack Shack. You’ll get to hear HPE speaker sessions on how to scale machine learning without compromising privacy and view a tutorial on how to use the Container Storage Interface (CSI) primitives with Kubernetes. Using machine learning to harness data and operationalize data pipelines using KubeDirector and other products in the HPE Ezmeral Software Portfolio will also be highlighted throughout the virtual booth. [Check here for details on HPE’s overall presence at the event](https://community.hpe.com/t5/hpe-ezmeral-uncut/hpe-showcasing-enterprise-edge-to-cloud-solutions-at-kubecon/ba-p/7107337).## Explore our virtual Hack Shack and see what’s new!

The HPE DEV Community Hack Shack offers developers, designers, and data scientists the opportunity to connect with HPE subject matter experts and collaborate with them to accelerate innovation using open source and HPE technologies. It’s a unique place designed to give virtual events a more personal touch and extend the experience beyond the event.

The HPE DEV team is pleased to now offer Workshops-on-Demand through the Hack Shack. In our technical workshops, you’ll learn about HPE and open source solutions and get hands-on experience with these technologies, including the HPE Ezmeral Container REST API.

Here’s a snapshot of what you will find in the virtual Hack Shack:

* [WORKSHOPS:](/hackshack/workshops) Check out our Workshops-on-Demand. These are free, hands-on training sessions you can access at any time, from anywhere. Using a Jupyter Notebook environment, you’ll have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience across different technologies, like Grommet and the HPE Ezmeral Container Platform REST API.
* [CHALLENGES:](/hackshack/challenges) Our coding challenge offers an exciting opportunity to put what you’ve learned to the test and compete with others for prizes. This challenge will task you with deploying a sample front-end application on a CNCF-certified Kubernetes cluster running on HPE Ezmeral Container Platform using the API calls.
* [REPLAYS:](/hackshack/replays) Augmenting our Workshops-on-Demand, we’ve posted replays of many of the technical workshops we’ve offered live in the past. View them to learn more about the [HPE Ezmeral Container Platform](/hackshack/replays/1), [SPIFFE and SPIRE authentication](/hackshack/replays/5), and the [HPE Container Storage Interface](/hackshack/replays/2) for Kubernetes.
* [HPE EZMERAL:](/hackshack/ezmeral) We’ve made it easy for you to find detailed information on the [HPE Ezmeral Container Platform](https://developer.hpe.com/platform/hpe-ezmeral-container-platform/home), [HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric](https://developer.hpe.com/platform/hpe-ezmeral-data-fabric/home), [HPE Ezmeral ML Ops](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/solutions/machine-learning-operations.html), along with other products in this innovative set of software that can be deployed on any cloud, on any hardware, and is 100% open source Kubernetes.
* [ARCADE:](/hackshack/arcade)  In our arcade, along with a bunch of cool stickers, you’ll find Hack Shack Attack! Give our popular retro-style video game a try and compete with your friends for the highest score.
* [COMMUNITY:](/hackshack/community)  We invite you to join and contribute your expertise in our blog forum or deliver an on-demand workshop. Connect with others in the community via [Slack](https://slack.hpedev.io/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HPE_DevCom) channels to start conversations and get answers to questions. And you can sign-up for our HPE DEV Newsletter to stay up-to-date on the newest blog posts and tutorials.

## Prizes? Did someone say prizes?

Take our [HPE DEV Hack Shack coding challenge](/hackshack/challenges) and you could win a prize! Our coding challenges are timed events where developers are asked to create their own code to achieve a defined function while taking specific parameters into account. For KubeCon | CloudNativeCon NA, we will be challenging you to deploy a sample front-end application on a CNCF-certified Kubernetes cluster running on HPE Ezmeral Container Platform using the API calls. Submissions will be judged on technical achievement and completeness of the code and quiz answers. For details on how to participate, [please refer to this blog post](/blog/hpe-dev-hack-shack-coding-challenges-are-you-ready-to-compete).

Virtual events can be challenging to engage and talk to the right people. Many who attend physical conferences come specifically to talk with industry and subject matter experts. That’s why the [HPE DEV community](https://developer.hpe.com/community) has worked hard to deliver its [HPE DEV Community Hack Shack](/hackshack/) virtual experience. We want to ensure you have a place where you can do just that. For questions or help, be sure to connect with us in our virtual room at the booth or on our [HPE DEV Slack Channel](https://slack.hpedev.io/).
