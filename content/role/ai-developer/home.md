An AI developer is a software professional who designs, builds, and integrates artificial intelligence capabilities into applications, using programming languages like Python to create systems that can learn, reason, and automate tasks, often by working with machine learning models, natural language processing (NLP), or computer vision for real-world problem-solving. They focus on making AI functional in software, bridging the gap between complex AI research and practical user experiences, and work on everything from developing foundation models to applying existing ones 

** Key Responsibilities:**
* Coding & Implementation: Writing code to develop AI algorithms, training models, and embedding them into software.\
* Data Management: Preparing, cleaning, and engineering features from large datasets for model training. 
* Model Development: Designing, training, testing, and optimizing machine learning models (e.g., neural networks, LLMs). 
* Integration: Connecting AI models with existing systems through APIs to create functional applications (e.g., chatbots, recommendation engines). 
* Collaboration: Working with stakeholders and other developers to understand needs and explain complex AI concepts.
