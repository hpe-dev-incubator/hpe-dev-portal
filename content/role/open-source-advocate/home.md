To stay on the cutting edge, you know your organization needs the agility afforded by open source software and community collaboration. And that’s what you’ll find here. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) has always had a culture of open collaboration and giving back to the community. It’s in our DNA. Open source collaboration is the whole idea behind the HPE Developer Community, offering a place where HPE and external engineers can come together to accelerate innovation.

Our open source projects today focus on common problems customers are trying to solve; making hybrid IT simple, enabling cloud economics, programming data analyses on laptops through supercomputers, and securing digital infrastructure. But they go beyond providing innovative enterprise solutions to tackling global issues, such as ensuring the right people can access the right data wherever it’s needed to combat disease and hunger. We do so by contributing to projects focused on cloud-native application development, data fabric, and high performance computing (HPC), investing in future growth areas such as AI, machine learning, data science, and edge computing.

Explore community-powered innovation here as we highlight a few of the latest open source contributions from HPE. We encourage you to join these community efforts, contributing where and when you can.
