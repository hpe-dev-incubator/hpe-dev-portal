### Addressing Key Concerns

**Lowering the entry barriers to developing new AI/ML/data science projects**

  - AI/ML projects can and should be run on the same system as analytics projects: Read “Chapter 3: AI and Analytics Together” in the free eBook  [AI and Analytics at Scale: Lessons from Real-World Production Systems](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/resources/software/ai-and-analytics-systems.html)

 

**Getting started**

  - Consider [The New Data Science Team: Who’s on First?](https://community.hpe.com/t5/hpe-ezmeral-uncut/the-new-data-science-team-who-s-on-first/ba-p/7154783#.Y4Zsq-zMLlw)

  - Explore Deep learning model training – a first-time user’s experience with Determined [Part 1](/blog/deep-learning-model-training-–-a-first-time-user’s-experience-with-determined-part-1/) and [Part 2](/blog/deep-learning-model-training-–-a-first-time-user’s-experience-with-determined-–-part-2/)


 

**Handling data movement**

  - Read [A better approach to major data motion: built-in data mirroring](https://community.hpe.com/t5/HPE-Ezmeral-Uncut/A-better-approach-to-major-data-motion-Efficient-built-in/ba-p/7135056#.Ya5Xqb3ML0p)

  - Watch the webinar [Data Motion at Scale: the Untold Story](https://www.hpe.com/h22228/video-gallery/us/en/5a1ff1b7-faf8-43f2-98a3-d5b7331616b6/video?jumpid=em_4pbhacrk27_aid-520049397&utm_source=RE)

**Dealing with edge computing in large-scale systems**

  - Read [To the edge and back again: Meeting the challenges of edge computing](https://community.hpe.com/t5/HPE-Ezmeral-Uncut/To-the-edge-and-back-again-Meeting-the-challenges-of-edge/ba-p/7132609#.Ya5X3r3ML0o)

 

**Ensuring data trust and security**

  - View [Dataspaces: connecting to data you can trust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VTLA1nxpoo)

  - Explore the CNCF [SPIFFE and SPIRE projects](https://developer.hpe.com/platform/spiffe-and-spire-projects/home/)
