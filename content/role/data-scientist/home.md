Data powers today. And it’s your job to ensure the right data powers the right applications at the right time to ensure the right decisions are being made. Whether you use that data to personalize experiences, detect fraud, make recommendations or predictions, you need to be able to harness the data no matter where it is quickly and reliably.

With the increased number of workloads and open data access, how can you do this securely and affordably without further complicating the situation? The right data fabric can actually change the way you work, immensely simplifying operations. It can assist in data exploration, preparation, versioning, movement, and protection.

When you use [HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric](https://community.hpe.com/t5/HPE-Ezmeral-Uncut/If-HPE-Ezmeral-Data-Fabric-is-the-answer-what-is-the-question/ba-p/7092812#.YSO2-Y5Kg2x), you can build data structures that span your enterprise across clouds, facilitating data movement, ensuring accuracy, and safeguarding access, no matter the data format nor what systems are used. Use it to power use cases from building data pipelines to support AI and machine learning applications. Use it to share data so that data analytics and data science / AI approaches can run side-by-side.

You’re sure to have questions. We’re here to get them answered. Here are a few things to get you started. Be sure to ping us on [Slack](https://slack.hpedev.io/) if you have any questions or need more information.
