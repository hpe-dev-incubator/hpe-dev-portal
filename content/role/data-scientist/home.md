Data science is an intriguing field, and recognition of its potential is rapidly expanding. But there are challenges. You need access to the right data and the flexibility to use a variety of tools of your own choice. The pipeline for data preparation and for model and application deployment needs to be reliable and efficient. And you need to increase the likelihood that stakeholders and IT managers will green-light new projects.

On this page, we provide a range of content – for advanced data scientists to those just getting started – to help you meet these challenges. You will find a rotating selection of foundational material, ideas to help you get inspired, as well as practical tips on key issues that help make your data science projects easier to build and more likely to be successful. You’ll also learn what Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) offers. 

The roles of the Data/ML Engineer and Data Scientist can overlap. You may also find content of interest to you on the [Data/ML Engineer](https://deploy-preview-896--hpe-dev-portal.netlify.app/role/data-ml-engineer/home/) page. Content on this page changes as new material becomes available or new topics arise, so check back regularly.
