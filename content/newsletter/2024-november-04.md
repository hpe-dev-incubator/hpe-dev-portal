description: Our newest AI Jam series is a hit! Two more are on their way. Ted Dunning joins us for our November Munch & Learn to discuss how to plug your biggest security hole and our Meetups reconvene in December where we’ll introduce you to HPE’s LL-Mesh. Note that Morpheus has just been added to our Community portal. In this edition, we also highlight a new blog post from HPE Hybrid Cloud CTO, Brian Gruttadauria, and a new blog series featuring actual customer use cases. Enjoy another fascinating issue of our newsletter!
