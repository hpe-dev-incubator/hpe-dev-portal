[HPE Ezmeral Runtime Enterprise](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/software/ezmeral-runtime.html) – (formerly known as the HPE Ezmeral Container Platform) is a secure, enterprise-grade platform to build and deploy cloud-native and non-cloud-native (i.e., legacy) applications at scale across data centers, multiple clouds, and at the edge for a wide range of use cases. It provides all the tools enterprise customers need to build, modernize, deploy, monitor and manage a wide range of AI and analytics workloads to unleash their data’s full potential and accelerate their data-driven digital transformation.

[HPE Ezmeral ML Ops](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/solutions/ezmeral-machine-learning-operations.html) – is a software solution that extends the capabilities of HPE Ezmeral Runtime Enterprise to support the entire machine learning (ML) lifecycle. HPE Ezmeral ML Ops is an end-to-end data science solution with the flexibility to run on-premises, in multiple public clouds, or in a hybrid model, and respond to dynamic business requirements in a variety of use cases. HPE Ezmeral ML Ops addresses the challenges of operationalizing ML models at enterprise scale by delivering a cloud-like experience combined with pre-packaged tools to operationalize the machine learning lifecycle.

[HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric File & Object Store](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/software/ezmeral-data-fabric.html) – is the industry’s first edge-to-cloud solution that ingests, stores in the native format, and completes in-place processing of different data types. It supports the most popular data and analytics APIs, which simplifies data access across the enterprise for all analytics users. 

[HPE Ezmeral Analytics](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/software/ezmeral-runtime.html)[ for Apache Spark](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/software/ezmeral-runtime.html) – features native integration of Apache Spark Kubernetes Operator and offers a unified data experience to securely connect to data wherever it exists.

HPE Ezmeral supports the most popular open-source ML Ops, Airflow, MLflow, and Kubeflow projects while integrating with an ever-growing ecosystem of certified HPE ISV partners.

The associated [BlueK8s open source initiative](https://github.com/bluek8s) will include a number of projects to help bring enterprise-level capabilities for distributed stateful applications to Kubernetes. The first open source project in this initiative is Kubernetes Director, or [KubeDirector](https://kubedirector.io/) for short. (See [Projects](#projects) for specifics).
