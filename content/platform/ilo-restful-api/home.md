# One Interface for Server Management Automation

HPE Server management provides intelligent remote control automation through [HPE Integrated Lights-Out](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/hpe-integrated-lights-out-ilo.html) (iLO) and the Redfish® iLO RESTful API. Gain even more capabilities that go beyond scripting by leveraging one API to manage your complete lifecycle of HPE Gen10, Gen10 Plus and Gen11 servers.

A single API interface integrates server management components and full compute power. Use it with HPE iLO 5 and iLO 6 to perform remote server provisioning, configuration, inventory and monitoring industry standards through Redfish API conformance.

# HPE Redfish API Implementation

Obtain simple, secure management of today’s scalable data center hardware with the Redfish® API ecosystem. It’s an open industry-standard specification and schema that helps you integrate solutions within your existing tools. Published by the Distributed Management Task Force ([DMTF](http://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish)), it's ideal for cloud and web-based infrastructures, which typically have large quantities of servers in heterogeneous environments.
