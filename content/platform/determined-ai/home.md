Building and training optimized models at scale is considered the most demanding and critical stage of machine learning (ML) development. [Determined AI](https://www.determined.ai/) accelerates time-to-production with an open-source platform to build and train models faster and easier. 

Determined AI helps researchers and scientists focus on innovation and accelerate their time-to-delivery by removing the complexity and cost associated with machine learning development. This includes making it easy to set-up, configure, manage and share workstations or AI clusters that run on-premise or in the cloud. 

Determined enables you to: 

* **Train models faster** using state-of-the-art distributed training without changing your model code. 

* **Automatically find high-quality models** with advanced hyperparameter tuning from the creators of Hyperband. 

* **Get more from your GPUs** with smart scheduling and cut cloud GPU costs by seamlessly using spot instances. 

* **Track and reproduce your work** with experiment tracking that works out-of-the-box, covering code versions, metrics, checkpoints, and hyperparameters. 


Determined integrates these features into an easy-to-use, high-performance machine learning environment — which means you can spend your time building models instead of managing infrastructure. 

Since the open-source project launched in 2020, and as a result of its focus on model training, Determined AI has quickly emerged as a leading training tool in the evolving machine learning software ecosystem. Its solution has been adopted by users across a wide range of industries, such as biopharmaceuticals, autonomous vehicles, defense contracting, and manufacturing.
