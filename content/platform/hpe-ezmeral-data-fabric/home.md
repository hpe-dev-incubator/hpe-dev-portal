You can store, manage and access your data from edge to core to cloud at any scale or speed that you need. You can build data structures that span your enterprise using the data fabric to handle data storage and motion. Your current systems can access data in the fabric, and the same bits can be processed by cloud native applications.

### [Ezmeral Data Fabric for Predictive Maintenance ![](Github)](https://github.com/mapr-demos/predictive-maintenance)

This project is intended to show how to build Predictive Maintenance applications on Ezmeral Data Fabric. Predictive Maintenance applications place high demands on data streaming, time-series data storage, and machine learning. Therefore, this project focuses on data ingest with Ezmeral Data Fabric Event Store, time-series data storage with Ezmeral Data Fabric Database and OpenTSDB, and feature engineering with Ezmeral Data Fabric Database and Apache Spark. The source code of the Predictive Maintenance application is available in this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mapr-demos/predictive-maintenance). Look at the project [Readme](https://github.com/mapr-demos/predictive-maintenance/blob/master/README.md) to get more informations about this sample application.

### [Customer 360 View ![](Github)](https://github.com/mapr-demos/customer360)

Customer 360 applications require the ability to access data lakes containing structured and unstructured data, integrate data sets, and run operational and analytical workloads simultaneously. MapR enables applications to glean customer intelligence through machine learning that relates to customer personality, sentiment, propensity to buy, and likelihood to churn. This application focuses on showing how the following three tenants to customer 360 applications can be achieved on Ezmeral Data Fabric:

1. Big Data storage of structured and semi-structured data in files, tables, and streams
2. SQL-based data integration of disparate datasets
3. Predictive analytics through machine learning insights

The source code of the Customer 360 View application is available in this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mapr-demos/customer360).

### [Application for Processing Stock Market Trade Data ![](Github)](https://github.com/mapr-demos/finserv-application-blueprint)

This project provides an engine for processing real time streams trading data from stock exchanges. The application consists of the following components:

* A Producer microservice that streams trades using the NYSE TAQ format
  * The data source is the Daily Trades dataset described here
  * The schema for our data is detailed in Table 6, "Daily Trades File Data Fields", on page 26 of Daily TAQ Client Specification (from December 1st, 2013)
* A multi-threaded Consumer microservice that indexes the trades by receiver and sender
* Example Spark code for querying the indexed streams at interactive speeds, enabling Spark SQL queries
* Example code for persisting the streaming data to Ezmeral Data Fabric Database
* Performance tests for benchmarking different configurations
* A supplementary python script to enhance the above TAQ dataset with "level 2" bid and ask data at a user-defined rate

The source code of the Application for Processing Stock Market Trade Data application is available in this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mapr-demos/finserv-application-blueprint).
