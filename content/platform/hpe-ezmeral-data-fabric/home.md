HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric centralizes different data types across on-premises, multiple clouds, and edge deployments into a single logical data store.  It breaks down silos and stops the endless cycle of merging, remerging, and redeploying data silos into new silos. 

HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric allows data analysts, engineers, and scientists to deliver real-time and predictive models organizations can trust. Built-in industry-standard APIs, languages, and protocols increase productivity by preserving existing access mechanisms without low-value refactoring. 

Supports files, object, NoSQL databases, and streams

* [Data Fabric file store](https://docs.datafabric.hpe.com/70/MapROverview/File-Store.html#MapR-XD)
* [Data Fabric object store](https://docs.datafabric.hpe.com/70/MapROverview/HPE-Ezmeral-Data-Fabric-Object-Store.html)
* [Data Fabric database](https://docs.datafabric.hpe.com/70/MapROverview/maprDB-overview.html#maprDB-overview)
* [Data Fabric data streams](https://docs.datafabric.hpe.com/70/MapROverview/c_mapr_streams.html)

[HPE Ezmeral Ecosystem Pack includes](https://docs.datafabric.hpe.com/70/c_ecosystem_intro.html) certified open-source tools and engines that integrate directly on top of the data fabric. It enables in-place analytics no matter where data is located and reduces time spent integrating and configuring open source tools.
