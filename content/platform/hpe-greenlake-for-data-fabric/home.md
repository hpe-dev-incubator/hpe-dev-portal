HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric is a new offering from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). It is positioned as a multi-modal hybrid data plane for the enterprise.

For the global enterprise, multi-cloud hybrid is a reality, with 80% of enterprises running their IT operations across multiple public clouds and on-premises data centers or co-locations. 

For many decades, enterprises have struggled with issues caused by having islands of data, firstly across internal IT systems, and now exacerbated by cloud separation. They have been faced with challenges of providing insight into available assets, a single view, a single version of truth, management across silos, governance, and security – all multiplied in effort and complexity with public clouds. 

HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric has been designed to address the many challenges enterprises face in dealing with big data, such as:

1. The difficulty in moving data 

2. The need to re-factor applications when switching between on and off premises

3. Relocating data on premises ensures vendor lock-in, since it costs too much to move out

4. It’s difficult to stage data near a cloud in order to enable bursting, as needed


To address these challenges, HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric enables features like Global Namespace, a consistent application layer that supports a broad range of APIs, languages and protocols that developers and data scientists can leverage to address multiple analytics use cases (data analytics, AI/ML),  multi-modal interfaces (NFS, S3, Kafka and HDFS) and data transport solutions. It also enables a fine-grained consumption model and associated pricing.

HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric strives to enable this abstraction for quantifiable business outcomes. It lets customers focus on their business instead of spending time and effort constantly trying to find and relocate data.
