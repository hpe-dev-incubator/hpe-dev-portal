HPE’s observability platform called OpsRamp is a comprehensive Autonomous IT operations platform designed to help service providers and enterprises modernize and streamline their IT operations. OpsRamp integrates artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and analytics to provide visibility, monitoring, and management across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. It addresses the challenges of complex IT infrastructures by offering tools for unified observability, proactive monitoring, incident management, and remediation.

## API Documentation

The OpsRamp API is a robust set of RESTful APIs designed to integrate and automate various IT operations management processes. These APIs allow developers to interact programmatically with the OpsRamp platform, enabling advanced customization, data exchange, and workflow automation across IT environments. Detailed information can be found on the [OpsRamp documentation](https://develop.opsramp.com/v2) site.

## Integrations

OpsRamp offers an extensive range of integrations that enhance its capabilities for IT operations management. These integrations span across various domains, including service management platforms like ServiceNow and Jira, monitoring and observability tools such as Prometheus, backup and recovery systems like Zerto, and cloud-native systems such as Kubernetes. 

Additionally, OpsRamp supports integration with popular automation tools like Ansible and comprehensive export options to cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage. Detailed documentation on all integrations can be found at [www.docs.opsramp.com/integrations](https://docs.opsramp.com/integrations/).    

* **Custom Integrations:** OpsRamp's custom integration framework enables users to create webhook and OAuth2 integrations for data ingestion and event capture within the platform. It offers flexibility to build integrations through either the OpsRamp APIs or the web interface. This framework is designed to accommodate diverse use cases, such as integrating custom alert sources, enabling ticketing workflows, or syncing with external systems, all while providing tools for validation and auditing of integration setups. For further details, visit the [OpsRamp Custom Integration documentation](https://docs.opsramp.com/integrations/a2r/custom-integration/custom-integration/).    

* **OpenTelemetry Integration:** OpsRamp's [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) integration enables organizations to achieve seamless distributed tracing across their IT environments. By leveraging OpenTelemetry, an open-source observability framework, OpsRamp provides a vendor-agnostic solution for capturing and visualizing trace data. This integration helps teams gain end-to-end visibility into the lifecycle of requests spanning microservices, APIs, and other system components, allowing for the identification of latency issues and performance bottlenecks.<br/> <br/>
The platform supports easy instrumentation using OpenTelemetry’s libraries and SDKs, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of programming languages and environments. The resulting trace data can be visualized using OpsRamp's intuitive interfaces, such as flame graphs and service insights, for efficient performance analysis and troubleshooting. This integration empowers IT and development teams to optimize their distributed systems while maintaining flexibility and industry standards in their observability strategies. For further details, visit the [OpenTelemetry integration documentation](https://docs.opsramp.com/integrations/a2r/3rd-party/opentelemetry-integration/).    

* **Kubernetes Integration:** OpsRamp’s Kubernetes (K8s) integration provides robust monitoring and management of containerized environments. It supports Kubernetes clusters deployed across various cloud providers and on-premises setups. By integrating with Kubernetes, OpsRamp offers capabilities such as automated resource discovery, real-time monitoring of nodes, pods, and services, and visualization of cluster health and performance metrics. The platform enables users to customize monitoring thresholds, set alert conditions, and leverage detailed dashboards for better insight into their Kubernetes workloads. This integration helps ensure operational efficiency and scalability in managing containerized applications across diverse environments. For further details, visit the [Kubernetes integration documentation](https://docs.opsramp.com/integrations/container-orchestration/kubernetes-new/).    

* **Ansible Integration:** OpsRamp's [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) integration enables automation of a wide range of tasks across hybrid infrastructures. It supports agent deployment, updates, and uninstallation, but also goes further by automating diagnostic health checks and performing remediation actions to maintain system stability. Through the use of Ansible playbooks, IT teams can automate the identification and resolution of issues, enforce compliance, and ensure system health. This integration also includes secure management of sensitive data with Ansible Vault, making it a powerful tool for streamlining IT operations and ensuring consistency and efficiency across diverse environments.
