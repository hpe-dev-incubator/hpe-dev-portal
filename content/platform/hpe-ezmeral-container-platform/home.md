**HPE Ezmeral Container Platform** is the industry’s first enterprise-grade container platform designed to deploy both cloud-native and non-cloud-native applications using Kubernetes – running on bare-metal or virtualized infrastructure, on any public cloud, and at the edge.

HPE Ezmeral Container platform brings together IP from HPE’s acquisitions of BlueData and MapR along with 100% open source Kubernetes to deliver a fully integrated comprehensive container platform solution.

The [BlueK8s open source](https://github.com/bluek8s) initiative will include a number of projects to help bring enterprise-level capabilities for distributed stateful applications to Kubernetes.

The first open source project in this initiative is Kubernetes Director or KubeDirector for short.
