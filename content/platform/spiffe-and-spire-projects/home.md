Inspired by production infrastructure at Facebook, Google, Netflix, and more, SPIFFE is a set of open-source standards for securely authenticating software services in dynamic and heterogeneous infrastructures through platform-agnostic, cryptographic identities. SPIRE is an open-source system that implements the SPIFFE specification in a wide variety of environments.

Together, the projects deliver a foundational capability, *service identity*, for cloud- and container-deployed microservices. They enable organizations to deploy consistent, fine-grained cross-service authentication via a “dial-tone” API across heterogeneous environments.

[SPIFFE and SPIRE are graduated projects](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2022/09/20/spiffe-and-spire-projects-graduate-from-cloud-native-computing-foundation-incubator/) from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Joining the group of 16 already [CNCF graduted projects](https://www.cncf.io/projects/),  including HELM and Kubernetes, SPIFFE and SPIRE projects have received contributions from Bloomberg, Google, Pinterest, Square, Uber, and others and have grown to become a foundational layer within the cloud native ecosystem. These projects integrate with multiple cloud native technologies and projects, such as Istio, Envoy, gPRC, and OPA (Open Policy Agent).

You can download an eBook that presents the SPIFFE standard for service identity, and SPIRE, the reference implementation for SPIFFE [here](https://spiffe.io/book/).

# Integrations

* [Tutorial on how to configure the Envoy proxy with SPIFFE and SPIRE](https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/microservices/envoy/)
* [Tutorial on how to configure Istio with SPIRE](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/integrations/spire/). The Istio integration was contributed to by HPE engineers, and is now part of Istio, since V1.14.
