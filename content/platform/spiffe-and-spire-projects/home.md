Inspired by production infrastructure at Facebook, Google, Netflix, and more, SPIFFE is a set of open-source standards for securely authenticating software services in dynamic and heterogeneous infrastructures through platform-agnostic, cryptographic identities. SPIRE is an open-source system that implements the SPIFFE specification in a wide variety of environments.

Together, the projects deliver a foundational capability, *service identity*, for cloud- and container-deployed microservices. They enable organizations to deploy consistent, fine-grained cross-service authentication via a “dial-tone” API across heterogeneous environments.

[SPIFFE and SPIRE are graduated projects](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2022/09/20/spiffe-and-spire-projects-graduate-from-cloud-native-computing-foundation-incubator/) from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Joining the group of already [graduated projects](https://www.cncf.io/projects/),  including HELM and Kubernetes, SPIFFE and SPIRE projects have received contributions from Bloomberg, Google, Pinterest, Square, Uber, HPE and others and have grown to become a foundational layer within the cloud native ecosystem. These projects integrate with multiple cloud native technologies and projects, such as Istio, Envoy, gPRC, Sigstore, and OPA (Open Policy Agent).

You can download an eBook that presents the SPIFFE standard for service identity, and SPIRE, the reference implementation for SPIFFE [here](https://spiffe.io/book/).

# Learn from the experts

### Introduction to SPIFFE and SPIRE

In this lightboard video, Evan Gilman, co-author of O’Reilly’s book Zero Trust Networks and a maintainer for SPIRE, provides an overview of CNCF’s SPIFFE and SPIRE Projects. Evan goes into the security issues that SPIFFE/SPIRE solve and how through workload identity attestation.
