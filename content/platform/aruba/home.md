# Build awesome apps with Grommet

  [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io/) helps you create responsive and accessible mobile-first projects for the web with an [easy-to-use](https://v2.grommet.io/components), [react](https://reactjs.org/)-based component library that is part design system and part development framework.

  Grommet is used by developers and designers alike to build both enterprise-class and consumer-grade applications that can be used in web, desktop, and mobile-friendly formats. It underpins many of HPE’s software-defined platforms, like [HPE OneView](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/software.html), [HPE Nimble storage](https://developer.hpe.com/platform/nimble-storage/home), [HPE SimpliVity](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/simplivity.html), and [HPE Composable Fabric](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/integrated-systems/composable-fabric.html).
