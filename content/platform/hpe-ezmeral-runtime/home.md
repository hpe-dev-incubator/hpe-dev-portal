**HPE Ezmeral Runtime** (previously called HPE Ezmeral Container Platform) is the industry’s first enterprise-grade container orchestration platform that is designed to run modern applications (both cloud-native and non-cloud-native) with persistent data. It deploys 100% Kubernetes for orchestration, provides a state-of-the-art file system and data fabric for persistent container storage, and provides an enterprise with the ability to deploy non-cloud-native AI and Analytics workloads in containers. Enterprises can now easily extend the agility and efficiency benefits of containers to more of their enterprise applications running on either bare-metal or virtualized infrastructure, on-premises, in hybrid- and multi-cloud environments, or at the edge.

The associated [BlueK8s open source initiative](https://github.com/bluek8s) will include a number of projects to help bring enterprise-level capabilities for distributed stateful applications to Kubernetes. The first open source project in this initiative is Kubernetes Director, or [KubeDirector](https://kubedirector.io) for short.
