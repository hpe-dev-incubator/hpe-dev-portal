[HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/hpe-greenlake-private-cloud-enterprise.html) reimagines the private cloud experience with a scalable, pay-per-use, enterprise-grade solution delivered to you as a managed service across your locations — from edge to cloud. Built for both cloud-native and traditional applications, it supports the self‑service deployment of container, bare metal, and virtual machine services.

Its design principles are centered on leveraging open standards and open systems, preventing vendor lock-in with the ability to place your workloads in the environment of your choice based on cost and performance. You also get the full advantage of modern DevOps and automation with infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configuration management, REST APIs, and cloud command shell, for streamlined infrastructure provisioning and integration with existing DevOps/CI toolchains—speeding deployments for cloud admins and developers alike.

## HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise services

### Containers
 
Provision Kubernetes clusters on-demand to deploy and scale containerized applications and cloud-native workloads. The default container service is built on the HPE Ezmeral Runtime Environment and based on CNCF-compliant Kubernetes. You can create container clusters using VMs and/or bare-metal compute instances to meet a range of performance requirements.

HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise also supports select third-party container platforms such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes (EKS), so you can leverage the same container runtimes in your public and private cloud, streamlining workload portability and providing a consistent cloud-native experience across hybrid clouds for cloud or tenant admins (cloud system admins, DevOps admins, and more) and cloud consumers (developers, project contributors, and such).
